They sing so well together.","I know, that is one of the BEST shower scenes in the history of movies because it was part of the plot and it wasn't about nudity.","I'm not sure about the rest of the movie though. You saw it, right? It wasn't too great.","","I liked the way the camera gave her a sort of subtle grace and didn't try to go for titillation.
