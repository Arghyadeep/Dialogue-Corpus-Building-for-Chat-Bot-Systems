I love going new places.","Traveling is like taking wings and getting away from your normal life.","But speaking of getting away to places, I've been meaning to get down to the store and buy some new clothes. I've been wearing the same stuff for years, and it's time I got something new. What do you think I should get? IS there anything particular in style right now?","","You get to go somewhere else, be someone else, and just enjoy yourself. It's the greatest feeling in the world.","Everyone needs a break from the stresses and monotony of everyday life. When you travel, for a brief moment you can push worries of your life away pretend you have no responsibilities.","It's like being an angel! Or in my case, a demon, since when I travel I always get my fun from going around and sabotaging everyone else's enjoyment and just being a huge ass! I actually have a devil I wear and everything. We should vacation together, I'll show you."

I've been into VR lately, and using it to visit virtual destinations. Have you tried VR yet?","","I love going to new places, seeing new people, trying new foods. The entire experience is what makes life worth living. I don't know how I'd get by without travel.","It's always been my lifelong goal to travel the world. It's basically my biggest aspiration. To travel to every continent, excluding Antarctica of course. I want to visit all the major cities in the world, and lots of small hidden locations too. I guess I just want to see it all, and experience everything.","The moment I get too old to travel I will literally die then and there. I will just fall over dead, so that I can travel to my next and final destination. I wonder where I'll end up. Guess I'll still have one surprise to look forward to!"
