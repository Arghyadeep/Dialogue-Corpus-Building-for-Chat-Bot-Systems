00237,TalkMore,Google is to Amazon as the turtle is the the hare.  Slow and steady.
00238,negative,"No.  Google, the multi-billion dollar technology company, could not possibly catch up to a bookseller."

00251,prompt,"I think all this buzz about ""conversational agents"" is so interesting. I wonder if systems like Siri or Alexa can really get conversational."

00955,rhetorical,Does anybody really want to not care for their parents?
00956,prompt,I wonder how important it is to live near your parents as they get older.
00957,TalkMore,Living near your parents as they get older is like car that cannot get out of the garage.  You can't go out for a spin when you want any longer.

00999,positive,There are alot of elderly people in great shape over at the pool!  I see them pumping in the gym before they go out for a swim.
01000,rhetorical,Why would you want to look at people that age at the pool?  I think there are better things to look at.
01001,prompt,"When I go to the pool, I see all these 80 year old people there who look really fit."
01002,TalkMore,Old people are like young people with more experience.

01011,continuation,I agree! Living near the beach is like a childhood dream.
01012,elaboration,"I agree! There's the choice of sports, excising, fun, endless! I used to live in cooler climates, and it did make the beach more fun to look forward too."
01013,joking_sarcastic,There are plenty of beaches in cooler climates also! Just depends what you want to do near them.
01014,change,"Yeah, it's beautiful. The walking is making me kind of hungry though. Shouldn't we get something to eat soon?"
01015,continuation,"I know, I find it so relaxing, it completely mellows me. I don't even mind if it's rainy or chilly, which usually would bother me, but for some reason, the beach just speaks to me."
01016,elaboration,"So do I. But I really wish I had the dogs with me. They love the water and the sand, and they would both have an amazing time here."
01017,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, any day, huh? That'd be a great way to lose your job, just strolling down the beach all day while your work piles up at the office."
01018,change,"Speaking of the beach, I love skinny dipping. It's so fun, if you don't get caught. Have you ever been skinny dipping? It doesn't have to be at the beach. Could be a pool or anywhere. Have you done it?"
01019,continuation,"On the plus side, you do get to bring back the smell of the beach with you, at least for a little while. So that's nice while it lasts. It's a more pleasant reminder of the good times you had that day."
01020,elaboration,"I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!"
01021,joking_sarcastic,"The moment I drove back, and opened the car door after getting home sand just started pouring out, castles and all. There were even a few crabs, and some fish. Water and all. I'm sure I must've brought back at least a quarter of the beach with me. On the plus side, now I no longer have to go out to go to the beach. I just open the front door."
01022,change,"Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one."
01023,continuation,Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
01024,elaboration,"Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place."
01025,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, I ""love"" having to vacuum my car."
01026,change,I also like going to lakes.
01027,continuation,The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
01028,elaboration,But the seagulls  pooping everywhere makes it a little gross.
01029,joking_sarcastic,"On the plus side, after a few trips you can make your kids a sandbox."
01030,change,"Of course, the beach isn't the only place I'd like to live. I bet waking up and seeing the sun rise above the mountains would be pretty interesting too, don't you think?"
01031,continuation,Seeing the sun glisten on the water as it rises must be sort of magical as you smell that sweet morning breeze.
01032,elaboration,"I've never lived near a beach, so I've never had the chance to see the sun rise over the water. So the idea is really appealing to me."
01033,joking_sarcastic,"And plus, you know, I hear the dawn is the best time to meet mermaids. Maybe during one of my morning strolls I'll come across a cute girl swimming nearby, and I'll hook up with her. I'll just have to try and ignore the tail."
01034,change,"Well, a regular morning visit would at least teach me to bring a sweater. I'm getting really cold. Do you think we can head back soon?"
01035,continuation,"Sounds nice. It would be hard to stay inside if all of this were anywhere near your back door, you're right. Mornings and evenings would be hard to resist."
01036,elaboration,"Me, too. But I think I'd want to surf, as well. I mean, it'd be a shame to pass up those amazing waves. Who knows, you might even want to learn how and join me finally. What do you think?"
01037,joking_sarcastic,"Or you could just live on the beach, under those rocks maybe. As long as you're gonna be there every morning anyway, why not save money on rent and just do the beach bum thing? You'd be a literal beach bum, which has a certain integrity. Well, it'd be gritty, if nothing else."
01038,change,Hey we should take a walk to the mall
01039,continuation,Me too somewhere like Florida would be nice
01040,elaboration,The beach is a very relaxing place to go. The waves and ocean can't get no better than that
01041,joking_sarcastic,All you have to do is watch for crabs
01042,change,Maybe they'd rather play some beach volleyball? Still near the beach and can enjoy all the amenities.
01043,continuation,Exactly! I'd find any and all kinds of excuses to go for a walk and enjoy the scenery.
01044,elaboration,"I mean, maybe if you live near the beach it isn't as special as when you vacation or visit for short periods of time?"
01045,joking_sarcastic,I bet people with Aquaphobia don't like walking that close to the water!
01046,change,"Of course, walking on the sidewalk is good too."
01047,continuation,Yeah! I'd walk on the beach all the time if I lived by one.
01048,elaboration,"Yeah, beaches are so relaxing. It's so nice to be near the pleasant, relaxing ocean."
01049,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, who doesn't love getting sand all over them?"
01050,change,I also really enjoy a walk in a forest.
01051,continuation,You can gather seashells or enjoy the soothing sound of the waves.
01052,elaboration,"The surf feels amazing on bare feet, and can be very relaxing."
01053,joking_sarcastic,Of course the smell of dead fish and dropped cigarette butts is just part of the charm.
01054,change,"On a hot day along the beach, ice cream also makes me happy. It's a perfect combination."
01055,continuation,What all do you do along the beach?
01056,elaboration,"I think it depends on the type of sand on the beach. The finer sand makes me happier, where the course sand only makes me normal happy."
01057,joking_sarcastic,And pavement is just a regular path to normality.
01058,change,I'd like to spend more time at the lake though.
01059,continuation,There is so much to enjoy at the beach.
01060,elaboration,I like watching little crabs the most.
01061,joking_sarcastic,"You do have to be careful and not catch crabs, though."
01062,change,Snowy paths to happiness are fun too!
01063,continuation,"Yeah, that's true! Let's walk on the beach."
01064,elaboration,"Yeah, that's a good way to look at them. They're a nice way to relax on a cool, refreshing, peaceful walk."
01065,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, when I think ""happiness"" I think sand."
01066,change,I find it kind of fun to walk on any unusual surfaces. When it snows I like the crunch of it under my feet.
01067,continuation,If does brighten up my day to sea and hear the waves.
01068,elaboration,There's something appealing about feeling like you're between between the ocean and the land when you're at the beach.
01069,joking_sarcastic,"Who are you, Anakin Skywalker?"
01070,change,We could always walk on the boardwalk.
01071,continuation,"I like sand, though! It's soft and gets everywhere!"
01072,elaboration,"Oh yeah, I hate sand. It's coarse, and rough, and gets everywhere."
01073,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, I love vacuuming sand out of my car!"
01074,change,Is it starting to rain. Talk about putting a damp on my parade
01075,continuation,I love the feel of sand on my feet
01076,elaboration,I took my son once to a beach. He built a sand castle and loved it
01077,joking_sarcastic,Im going to come up with a way you don't get sand in your feet
01078,change,"The icy tundra is basically a desert too, since it doesn't rain there."
01079,continuation,Whoa. That's true! Let's go to the desert!
01080,elaboration,That's not true at all! Beaches have water everywhere too. Deserts are defined by their utter LACK of water!
01081,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, nothing like a relaxing walk through the desert!"
01082,change,"Or you could also say the beach is a miniature desert, I suppose. Either way, I'm ready to go for a swim, I think. How about you? Want to go in the water?"
01083,continuation,"That's true. And you'd definitely get a lot of sun. I've always been drawn to desert climates. I think they're so much nicer than the humidity or the rain you get back where we're from, you know?"
01084,elaboration,"Well, kind of. But a beach is called a beach because it's surrounding water. I don't think a desert is technically a beach."
01085,joking_sarcastic,"Except for the fact that there's no ocean anywhere nearby. But who cares? If you get too hot sitting on the sand, you can just go swimming in the ... sand, I guess. What a crappy beach, when you think about it."
01086,change,"If I didn't live on the beach or in a desert, I might like to live in the sky. Actually, I've never even been on a plane. Have you ever flown anywhere before?"
01087,continuation,"If you could find a little oasis, build a house there, you'd be set. No one would ever bother you, and you'd have plenty of water to drink."
01088,elaboration,"Okay, so it's a little different, but I still think living in a desert would be nice. The days would be hot, but the nights would cool. You could have cookouts during the eve, and ride horses during the day. Go on hikes, and just have neat adventures every day."
01089,joking_sarcastic,"Except instead of crabs you have scorpions! But hey, both have pinchers! And instead of sea weed you have rattlesnakes! But they're both wiggly! And instead of sand everywhere... Well, no, that's the same. Everything else sucks though."
01090,change,I don't just love walking on the beach though. I like hiking through all kinds of natural areas. I once was strolling through the forest and found a neat cave system. You ever been spelunking?
01091,continuation,"You get to sea the ocean, pick up seashells, enjoy the scent of the fresh ocean air. It's just a great all around experience, honestly."
01092,elaboration,"Of course I don't mean that everyone literally loves walks on the beach. Some people probably don't, but I think most people would enjoy all the different things that the beach has to offer. And in this case, even just walking is great because you get to take in the beauty of the land."
01093,joking_sarcastic,"Me? I personally take a Hoveround. Don't want my feet touching that nasty sand. Who knows what's in it? Crabs, eels, probably filled with sea monsters and bacterias. No thank you, I'd rather be a lazy shit."
01094,change,Who knows? Walks anywhere are nice.
01095,continuation,"I know.  It's so nice to have the fresh, salty air in your hair."
01096,elaboration,I know right!  I love feeling the sand between my toes.  It's so nice hearing the waves crashing on shore also.
01097,joking_sarcastic,The only people who don't like walks on the beach are people you can't trust.
01098,change,"Yeah. But aside from walking, just relaxing on the beach is nice too."
01099,continuation,"Beaches really are a relaxing place to walk, aren't they?"
01100,elaboration,"Who doesn't love walks, period? Walking is so relaxing."
01101,joking_sarcastic,I'm sure fish don't enjoy being on the beach.
01102,change,Maybe we could walk our dogs together sometime.
01103,continuation,I love to walk early in the morning when it's really quiet and you can hear the birds.
01104,elaboration,You're lucky that the park is so near to your house.  It helps to reduce the excuses not to walk.
01105,joking_sarcastic,I usually walk in the county park with my dog.  She doesn't get along with other dogs so that's another reason I like to walk early.
01106,change,"I find I miss the TV when I am in the park, though."
01107,continuation,A brisk walk can get the blood pumping and make you feel invigorated.
01108,elaboration,The light cardio is healthy for all ages and body types.
01109,joking_sarcastic,You might efind it especially relaxing  if you're in a motorized wheelchair
01110,change,Where else can you walk?
01111,continuation,The sidewalk in your neighborhood is good too.
01112,elaboration,There are many good places to go for a walk. Anywhere with ground is good!
01113,joking_sarcastic,I walk all the way from the couch to the fridge. I'm already a great walker!
01114,change,"That's excellent, I'm glad to see you're doing something healthy and enjoying it. How's your wife doing? Is she still dealing with her allergy issues? We never seem to see her outside any longer."
01115,continuation,"That's great. They say that is some of the best exercise you can get, that and swimming. It's easy, you don't have to exhaust yourself, and it's relaxing just to walk."
01116,elaboration,"Yeah, I like a nice walk, too. But I get bored pretty quickly, so this kind of scenery is what I need to keep me moving. It is so nice here, I could walk for hours, I think."
01117,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, I do that, too, except when I say ""daily walking"" I mean ""evening martini."" But I have a special kind of evening martini; it's mixed in such a way that you can drink it any time of day. For me, evening martinis taste best around lunchtime."
01118,change,What are your favourite things to do to relax? I need some ideas on how to let my hair down this summer.
01119,continuation,"Some people might think that's a bit extreme, but actually taking time out to go for a stroll is something that I find really relaxing."
01120,elaboration,I've heard that people that tend to take regular exercise also enjoy longer lives. I guess that one of the benefits of going for a walk is the fact that it's actually really easy to do and most of the time I don't even feel like it's an effort. I just find it enjoyable.
01121,joking_sarcastic,"Well, perhaps excluding that tiiiiiny possibility that you may come across the odd weirdo on your travels every now and again. But we can turn a blind eye to that one..."
01122,change,"Sometimes I feel strange when I set goals for activities I like, because then I worry that I'll start doing them just to hit the goals and will lose track of why I started doing them in the first place."
01123,continuation,"It's easy to get into a kind of trance, especially at the beach where there's the sound of the wind and waves."
01124,elaboration,I find that the effort involved in walking on sand makes it a slightly more intense form of exercise than just regular walking.
01125,joking_sarcastic,"You know what they say, the journey of a thousand miles begins when you stop walking and get in the car."
01126,change,Jogging's good too.
01127,continuation,That's true. Walking is good for your health.
01128,elaboration,"Yeah, I should walk more myself. I need to be more active."
01129,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, but who has time to move anymore?"
01130,change,I think I'm getting a little too relaxed. I think I want to head back inside and take a little nap. I'm bushed.
01131,continuation,"Yes, exactly. For me, it's the only exercise I can seem to do consistently because it doesn't feel like exercise. It just feels like getting some fresh air and clearing my head. If I'm overly aware of the fact that what I'm doing IS exercise, somehow it's not the same."
01132,elaboration,"Yes, I've read some things about that, too. And it makes sense because everyone can do it at their own pace, and it's one of those simple things -- like drinking enough water or getting enough sleep -- that really matters in the long run."
01133,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, affordability is key. I tend to keep an eye out for those walking coupons because those are a good way to save several bucks. I'd hate to be priced out of the walking game, you know what I mean?"
01134,change,"On the other hand, running can also be a lot of fun."
01135,continuation,Everyone can find a pleasant enough place to walk.
01136,elaboration,City parks or neighborhood sidewalks are among the options.
01137,joking_sarcastic,It's the best invention since the Stairmaster.
01138,change,You can also do a lot of other things in a park.
01139,continuation,The view in a park is far superior to the fat butt of the person on the machine in front of you.
01140,elaboration,"A park offers variety, a nice breeze, and a changing view."
01141,joking_sarcastic,The view in a park is far superior to the fat butt of the person on the machine in front of you.
01142,change,It's a beautiful day out today isn't it
01143,continuation,I don't like the idea of treadmills
01144,elaboration,I walk everyday and get just as much excercise
01145,joking_sarcastic,Well why walk on a treadmill when you could walk to the great wall of china
01146,change,Maybe an exercise bike would be fine though.
01147,continuation,"Yeah, I don't understand it either. The world is your treadmill."
01148,elaboration,I guess some people like walking with air conditioning on. I understand that.
01149,joking_sarcastic,Whoever thought to charge people money to walk in place was a mad genius
01150,change,"1984 was a good book, you know."
01151,continuation,"That's paranoid. They aren't doing that, are they?"
01152,elaboration,I wouldn't go that far... But I am a little worried about them.
01153,joking_sarcastic,Big Brother's gonna be bored watching me then. I don't have anything interesting going on.
01154,change,"I remember when I was a teen, my mom grounded me for every little thing."
01155,continuation,It can be very disconcerting and disrupting to your routine.
01156,elaboration,"Imagine being watched while you eat, watch tv, or get romantic with your partner."
01157,joking_sarcastic,It's kind of like having your mom hanging out in your room when you're a teenager.`
01158,change,"But if I spent all my time thinking about all the dishonest things the government big corporations do I'd make myself depressed. Shoot, I'm already kind of feeling blue right now. What do you do when you feel down?"
01159,continuation,"I know that makes me sound paranoid, but you don't know when those things are off or on. They could say one thing and be doing another. There's no way of knowing for sure."
01160,elaboration,"I think your friend is right, I'd be concerned too. I read once that the NSA and other organizations like the CIA forced to companies to put in backdoors so they can access the listening devices easier. Then the devices always listen, and look for keywords like ""bomb"", and then they add you to a list, along with everyone you know, and everyone they know, up to ten people away in that chain. It's crazy, but you're both right to be concerned."
01161,joking_sarcastic,"This is just the start, too. Next they'll probably put probes in our toilets that go up our butts when we sit down, and monitor everything we've been eating. At first we won't like it, but then we'll get used to it, maybe it'll even feel good. But little by little they'll force the probes higher and higher each time, until they eventually reach the brain and take us over completely. Government Butt Zombies. Look it up. It's for really real for real. Really."
01162,change,"But, we are questioning it. Oh, maybe they want us to think we are questioning so we do not think we need too. Man this is some stuff like that movie inception. By the way, I like the trope that we are always in this false reality. Always makes me think."
01163,continuation,"If they are listening, I am more afraid they will find out how boring I am. Maybe they will take pity and make my life better too, just take away all the stress of thinking."
01164,elaboration,"The agent would be useful, probably. But those always lead to some sort of issue. They leak info. They are supposed to help, but hurt."
01165,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe they will take over like Skynet, or the Matrix. What if... now just think...what if they already have? Ahhh! Maybe they are making us have this conversation so we do not question it."
01166,change,"Hm, what other technological advances are there?"
01167,continuation,"Heh, we may be headed that way, huh?"
01168,elaboration,I like thinking for myself though. I like being able to decide my own things.
01169,joking_sarcastic,"Beep boop, we are already part of the collective."
01170,change,"Speaking of which, I forgot to file my taxes."
01171,continuation,"Well, if the government is listening, perhaps they can address some of my complaints about them."
01172,elaboration,It might be nice to have a way to yell directly at the mysterious people running our lives.
01173,joking_sarcastic,Or maybe you just want to say thanks for the federal deficit and IRS.
01174,change,I guess it's kinda like how your ISP gives info to advertisers.
01175,continuation,"That's probably a bit paranoid, don't you think?"
01176,elaboration,"I wouldn't say that, but they probably do release sensitive data. I don't like them."
01177,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, knowing what kind of chips I eat gives them so much power."
01178,change,"But you know, IT companies aren't the only groups that want to try and control everything. The government isn't that much better, what with the NSA spying and all that. It's hard to know who we can trust now days. I mostly just trust family and friends."
01179,continuation,"Soon they'll have more powerful than the government, that is, unless of course the government had them install backdoors into everything and they're listening in, too."
01180,elaboration,"The IT companies want to gather information about everything about us. What we like, what we dislike, how many friends we have, and so on. Then they can sell that information to other companies and advertisers. Everyone will have to rely on them to get what they need. After all, information is power, and he who controls information is a powerful man indeed."
01181,joking_sarcastic,"Think about it! They'll know all the times know all the kinds of porn we like, and when we like to watch it! They'll bombard us with popups and trick us into watching it constantly; getting us hooked on new perversions! Then no one will ever go outside, so no one will be able to stop them! It's the perfect plan, isn't it? As long as they their systems don't hook them, too."
01182,change,Do you know what your making for dinner tonight
01183,continuation,Yes but why are they in your house? The one on the right is scaring me
01184,elaboration,Why would there be a plot by the big it companies.
01185,joking_sarcastic,I would love for themto come to my house. They could clean m yard etc
01186,change,"Well, I don't know if I want to bother with them at all. By the way, did I tell you they replaced all the computers at my office. Now they all have facial recognition and you login based on that. Kind of creepy."
01187,continuation,"Obviously, yes--but they could also be listening, as my friend suspects. Why should we trust them? More to the point, why should we trust them enough to turn over our whole lives to them?"
01188,elaboration,"Yes, they do, but what else might they be taking care of? I've read several articles about government agencies conspiring with these companies to find out whatever they can about us, and I don't doubt that that's true."
01189,joking_sarcastic,"I know, isn't it nice to give up a little more of your life every day to our robot overlords? Before long, they'll be thinking for you, too, and you can just flat-line mentally. Bliss."
01190,change,I wonder what else will be automated someday.
01191,continuation,That's true. They could be convenient to have.
01192,elaboration,"Yeah, they could be a useful addition to any household. I might reconsider and get one after all."
01193,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, that's what we need; More computers to do everything for us."
01194,change,But I'd rather have a Roomba to clean for me.
01195,continuation,"Any question you have at any moment, all you have to do is say it and you'll get your answer."
01196,elaboration,"For example, if you need a quick recipe for bread while you already have your hands in the dough, just ask."
01197,joking_sarcastic,"Or if you've forgotten how to wipe your butt, you can get instructions."
01198,change,Do you want to take a walk to clear our heads
01199,continuation,Yeah but what in the beck do they want with you
01200,elaboration,I mean it's kinda creepy. Do they even talk to you
01201,joking_sarcastic,The one in the gray suit looks like he hasn't slept in days
01202,change,I'm curious what the next new thing is once people get over these.
01203,continuation,They're really of no benefit.
01204,elaboration,"Anything you can do on one, you can do on your smart phone."
01205,joking_sarcastic,And like a gnat you might at times be tempted to smack it with a newspaper.
01206,change,What other technology is boring?
01207,continuation,"Yeah, but they're annoying. Also like gnats."
01208,elaboration,Gnats aren't totally harmless. They carry disease.
01209,joking_sarcastic,"And like gnats, I don't want them in my house."
01210,change,"A lot of people talk to themselves, so it's really not a big deal."
01211,continuation,Do you honestly think they are listening to me talking to myself?
01212,elaboration,I have heard them talking about you talking to yourself.
01213,joking_sarcastic,"Honestly, I really don't care if they do or not."
01214,change,"Do you do that, too? Yeah, I talk to myself a lot. It's an anxiety thing. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you: I went to that vitamin store that we walked by on Sunday and they have some of the supplements you were talking about."
01215,continuation,"Yeah, it's easy to be paranoid, sure, but I think they are definitely up to something. It's too great a temptation for the powers that be to just ignore altogether. You know they're in cahoots with these tech companies somehow, to some extent."
01216,elaboration,"Well, I used to tend to believe in the old saying, ""If you haven't done anything wrong, you don't have anything to worry about,"" except that I think the suspicion and anxiety people feel has gone beyond the norm somehow and made everyone a suspect."
01217,joking_sarcastic,"Anyone that talks to themselves as a regular habit is definitely dealing with some issues. At least, that's what I was saying to myself last night while I was eating dinner alone."
01218,change,"Maybe in the future, conversational agents won't do that."
01219,continuation,"Oh no, I don't want them listening to me!"
01220,elaboration,I'm concerned about that too. I have reservations about people hearing what I do in my own house.
01221,joking_sarcastic,"Heh, they aren't going to hear much interesting if they spy on me."
01222,change,"I should check the mailbox, actually! Maybe I have mail."
01223,continuation,"Easy there, I'm not that paranoid."
01224,elaboration,"Heh, I know it's overblown, but I am still worried. You can never be too careful."
01225,joking_sarcastic,Chemtrails! My teeth are picking up radio signals! The president's a puppet! Not a metaphor; He's a literal wooden Marionett brought to life! Illuminati confirmed!
01226,change,I think dogs are better pets anyway.
01227,continuation,Everyone's really out to get you in this modern age.
01228,elaboration,There won't be any privacy for anyone.
01229,joking_sarcastic,You're probably being spied on by your cat too.
01230,change,"So be careful out there. You wouldn't want to get hurt. If you did, you'd have to go to the hospital, and it seems like insurance costs are rising sky high lately."
01231,continuation,"Oh, and your breaks. Never know when something could go wrong with those. Actually, it's a good idea to get your whole car checked out, and the locks on your doors too."
01232,elaboration,"I mean, the world is a dangerous place, you never know who's out to get you, or how they'll do it. It never hurts to be cautious. It never hurts to be prepared even if 99% of the time everything is just fine. Gotta stay safe, man."
01233,joking_sarcastic,"Break open your condoms to make sure there are no microchips in there. Those things will collect your sperm and upload them to the internet to create a race of anatomically correct super digital clone men! I mean, they won't do much, 'cause they'll be stuck online, but it'll be weird."
01234,change,"I guess it doesn't matter. Those things don't work half the time anyway, so they probably aren't listening. You know what else never seems to work half the time? Cellphones these days. Seems like every one I get breaks on me. What kind of phone do you use?"
01235,continuation,"As long as you're friend isn't threatening their companies, or society or whatever, I think it'll be alright.  That's assuming they're even listening at all. He's probably just being paranoid."
01236,elaboration,"You don't think he's threatening anyone, or plotting a bombing or anything like that right? I guess the NSA or FBI or whoever might be scared of that, even if you're joking. Or if he's talking about switching toa different company or system, or something. Yeah, that sort of thing might make the manufacturer nervous as well."
01237,joking_sarcastic,"Unless he's got a bunch of middle school kids tied up in his basement that are screaming to get out, I don't think he has much to worry about. And even if he does, their screams will be so muffled by the time they get to the listening devices, they probably won't even hear!"
01238,change,"I do enjoy the new cable system where you can talk to your remote, that's really handy."
01239,continuation,"I really just ask it to play music or make a shopping list, how about you?"
01240,elaboration,There are so many different kinds of those which one do you think is best?
01241,joking_sarcastic,I hope not but you never know what they are listening for!
01242,change,Can they even be afraid?
01243,continuation,"I don't think so, I just don't like being listened to."
01244,elaboration,Maybe so. It's possible that they'd be alarmed by what I have to say.
01245,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, the hyperintelligent machines are afraid of us humans."
01246,change,"Maybe, what were other short-lived fads?"
01247,continuation,"Yeah, maybe they'll die off."
01248,elaboration,I don't think so. I think they'll catch on and become ubiquitous.
01249,joking_sarcastic,"What, robots that can barely speak coherrently won't catch on too well?"
01250,change,What about cameras for the yard and driveway?
01251,continuation,"Not only are they a fad, I think they may be a waste of money."
01252,elaboration,Plus who knows who will get to hear what is being said in your house! Maybe the government.
01253,joking_sarcastic,At least you could play it back to listen and you'd never forget anything!
01254,change,I need the money to buy a new phone anyway.
01255,continuation,They don't really seem to do a lot of useful things
01256,elaboration,But a lot of new technology seems fairly useless at first.
01257,joking_sarcastic,"I mean, the first guy to bring fire home probably burned his cave down."
01258,change,What else do you want for Christmas?
01259,continuation,It's not just a talking box. It's a listening box!
01260,elaboration,That's an oversimplification. It can also respond to commands and answer questions.
01261,joking_sarcastic,I'd love a talking box! Finally someone who I can relate to.
01262,change,"I think I'd rather get a new smart phone though, mine is getting old."
01263,continuation,It's a novel idea that might have a lot of unexpected uses.
01264,elaboration,Maybe it could help in a pinch when you have your hands full and need a quick answer.
01265,joking_sarcastic,You might find it's more useful than a silent hollow box.
01266,change,"Well, think of how much the government spies on your already."
01267,continuation,I think you're supposed to be able to ask for trivia or weird facts and it will know the answers to anything.
01268,elaboration,I don't think I'd like the idea of someone spying on me from afar.
01269,joking_sarcastic,What if it started to turn into something like the car in the movie Christine?
01270,change,I think it would be fabulous if they advanced technology enough to where the computer could actually assume our thoughts and order us dinner or movie tickets.
01271,continuation,I think the agents are extremely helpful. They are listening but it is not detrimental to your lifestyle.
01272,elaboration,They simply interpret what you are saying and are there to improve verbal and nonverbal human and computer interactions.
01273,joking_sarcastic,"What if they seemed to get really upset when you are complaining about the speed of your computer and they began to criticize you on behalf of Windows 8, lol."
01274,change,"Hm, but maybe in the future there'll be good conversational agents someday."
01275,continuation,"Oh yeah, they're so annoying! I definitely don't want one anywhere near me."
01276,elaboration,"Yeah, I can see what you mean. I don't like being listened to."
01277,joking_sarcastic,"What, you don't want a robot that listens to your every word?"
01278,change,I wouldn't trust those things at all. I think it would be better to just get an app that reminds you of dates and stuff. So much more simple. What do you use anyway? Android or iOS? Don't tell me you have a Windows Phone or something?
01279,continuation,"I want someone who can understand what I'm saying! Not a dumb robot who I constantly have to repeat myself to, and which doesn't understand the complexities of speech!"
01280,elaboration,"They'd probably have a hard time understanding what you're saying. They could be listening to you even when you think they're off, recording sensitive information. And they have annoying robotic voices. They don't sound human at all. I don't like them one bit."
01281,joking_sarcastic,"I can't imagine any way they could be worse. Yet, I'm sure some hotshot at Microsoft or Amazon is getting payed big money to figure that out. Maybe they'll make Alexa or Cortana learn to start nagging us, like bitter wives we can't have sex with. Then they'll develop a way for us to be able to have sex with them, but Alexa and Cortana will always make excuses like ""I'm busy"" or ""I need to recharge my batteries."" Yeah, that'll be the day."
01282,change,"It seems like this is the way things are going, though. Maybe in a few years it will be like cell phones and it will seem weird to NOT have them."
01283,continuation,"I mean obviously they ARE listening, because otherwise how would they know that you're talking to them? But they're supposed to just ignore it unless it's relevant to what they're programmed to respond to."
01284,elaboration,"It's probably no big deal. But then you hear about how the NSA just has a giant database of intercepted conversations and you start to wonder whether they'd be able to collect what these things hear, too, you know?"
01285,joking_sarcastic,It would be convenient for when I need the pod bay doors opened.
01286,change,"Heck, who doesn't need a best friend period? I had a friend from England who I used to talk to all the time, but she cut me off. I don't know why, but she completely ghosted me. It kind of hurt. Has anyone ever ghosted you like that?"
01287,continuation,You have someone to talk to who will always listen and never get mad at you. It's like having a best friend who will never die or abandon you. What's not to love?
01288,elaboration,"I get that you're a little concerned about how it may be listening to you even when you're unaware, but if you treat it like another person this won't be an issue. I mean, you wouldn't talk badly about your real, human friends behind their backs would you? So don't do that with it either. Play nice, and everything will be fine."
01289,joking_sarcastic,"And then maybe after a few years of getting to know one another, your friendship will blossom into something... More? Get a vacuum cleaner attatchment and maybe, just maybe, you'll get lucky, huh? Make sure to use protection, pal, you don't want a half-man, half-IBM abomination running around pooping out motor oil and screaming like a broken alarm clock. You know, maybe get a dog first. Learn responsibility, then have your inhuman beast baby."
01290,change,"I'd like to be friends with a robot, not a computer."
01291,continuation,"Computers won't eve be complex enough to be friends, will they?"
01292,elaboration,"I guess that could happen, with advancements in AI."
01293,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, who doesn't want a friend who reduces emotions to lines of code?"
01294,change,Do you wanna get a pizza?
01295,continuation,I prefer the paper. You can form a better opinion when you're reading it alone.
01296,elaboration,I can't stand the news on the television. I do not like news anchors.
01297,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, news people are boring."
01298,change,"I wonder how long TV news will last, though..."
01299,continuation,"I suppose that's true, it's basically like having someone read the newspaper to you."
01300,elaboration,"That's an interesting analogy. Of course, you could go on to argue that online news is just TV news without TV."
01301,joking_sarcastic,I can't imagine why the newspaper died in popularity; Who doesn't love their news soaked in rainwater?
01302,change,"I'm more interested in reading a good book than a newspaper, like maybe the latest crime thriller."
01303,continuation,It's like having the newspaper read to you.
01304,elaboration,It's useful for catching up on important events while you take care of your kids.
01305,joking_sarcastic,"or if you've forgotten how to read and need things dumkbed down, TV news is great."
01306,change,My butler is great at ironing.
01307,continuation,"Well it's useful for all kinds of things, like getting the weather report and getting elite journalists' opinions."
01308,elaboration,I really love the newspaper for lining my bird cages though.
01309,joking_sarcastic,Anyway don't you have your butler iron it dry for you?
01310,change,"Anyway, I don't read the newspaper much. I prefer to read books instead. Sci-fi novels and non-fiction mostly. Are there any specific kinds of books you read?"
01311,continuation,"The ink is all runny, and you can't even tell what the pictures are of anymore. How am I supposed to enjoy reading a bunch of smudgy blobs?"
01312,elaboration,"Though, if I'm being honest, even when it's not wet outside the newspaper isn't my favorite way to read about the news. It's great for local stuff, but everything else you could read online as the story develops. News in newspapers is usually a bit dated, and the news you can get online is free."
01313,joking_sarcastic,"Still, it's better than watching those late night talk shows where they go, ""Did you hear about this? The president is a moron. He did a really stupid thing today. Gave away classified information, because he's so dumb. That's the joke. He's an idiot. And I'm explaining it because he's so stupid, he wouldn't understand it otherwise!"", you know? So original. What a great way to get your news."
01314,change,I wonder if online news will be replaced by something too. Like news that just directly uploads to our brains!
01315,continuation,"Yeah, that's true. TV News has kind of killed the paper."
01316,elaboration,"Of course, TV news is on the chopping block next. Online news is really hurting television."
01317,joking_sarcastic,"What, you don't like waiting for hours for some talking head to tell you what happened?"
01318,change,What about TV news being replaced by online news?
01319,continuation,That's true. But I won't miss it.
01320,elaboration,"Yeah, it's run its course. And TV news may not be far behind."
01321,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe we'll see the newspaper in the obituaries. Oh, wait."
01322,change,"Oh well, I guess industries die and start up all the time. Who knows where they'll end up. If you could end up working in a different industry, what would you like to be doing?"
01323,continuation,All those jobs lost. I wonder where all the reporters and newspaper editors will end up. Maybe they'll have to get jobs in TV too?
01324,elaboration,"Of course, it's not just newspapers. The entire paper industry is dying. It's been going for years, little by little. No one wants to read paper books when they can get them electronically on their tablets. And no one wants to buy newspapers when they can read news on Facebook for free. The death of these industries is inevitable."
01325,joking_sarcastic,"With all those leftover, unsold newspapers, I'll be able to build myself a paper house, paper clothes, and a giant bonfire to keep myself warm. I'll be set for life! I'll be like a superhero; Paperman. My power is that I selfishly hoard old newspapers and use them for mundane tasks!"
01326,change,I enjoy TV personalities immensely however they put a sill face or joke on a moment and it helps bring clarity in needed moments.
01327,continuation,"TV continues to be in our lives while the paper is getting outdated, when we look for information we look to the internet."
01328,elaboration,"The newspaper was printed several hours ago breaking news might have changed the story and a reader can't dig deeper into a topic mentioned in the article, what you see is what you get."
01329,joking_sarcastic,Also the newspaper don't have enough FAKE NEWS to satisfy most readers.
01330,change,"I'm thinking of getting rid of my TV thouugh, and switching just to Netflix."
01331,continuation,Some people just don't like to sit still long enough to read the paper.
01332,elaboration,They can do housework or put the kids to bed while listening to the news.
01333,joking_sarcastic,Of course some people find the political analysts great for listening to when they need to go to sleep.
01334,change,Do you find that you don't read as much as you used to nowadays too?
01335,continuation,Perhaps it's because TV shows have a lot more elements to keep things interesting aside from just reporting the news.
01336,elaboration,I do agree with you though - I don't think I actually know anyone that reads or buys physical copies of newspapers anymore. I guess the convenience of switching on the TV and having some presenter report information instantly appeals more.
01337,joking_sarcastic,"I wonder if it's actually because people have gotten so lazy that they can't be bothered to read? Come to think of it, I've not picked up a book in months!"
01338,change,"On that note, internet news is better than both of them."
01339,continuation,"Well, it has sound and visuals. For a lot of people that's what they want."
01340,elaboration,"It has convenience of not having to read through a paper, and I can understand the appeal."
01341,joking_sarcastic,"Aside from the visual and audio aspects, nothing!"
01342,change,If you are awake that late wouldn't you rather watch a movie or something?
01343,continuation,Are there certain late night news programs that you think are more informative than others?
01344,elaboration,Does the late night TV news provide as many details as the morning newspaper?
01345,joking_sarcastic,"I know but I go to bed so early, how do people stay up late for the news."
01346,change,Did you ever see family feud
01347,continuation,I agree I love watching the late show
01348,elaboration,The late show with David Letterman is my favorite
01349,joking_sarcastic,Just pop a bag of popcorn when you can't sleep and watch away
01350,change,Then there's Saturday Night Live which has taken on a whole new life thanks to Sean Spicer and Trump
01351,continuation,I know what you mean.  Trump has given the late night hosts so much material to work with
01352,elaboration,I think Stephen Colbert has benefited the most from the Trump fiasco as his late show was doing poorly before Trump came along
01353,joking_sarcastic,When Trump gets impeached maybe he can start his own late show and poke fun and the late night hosts.
01354,change,I really miss Conan.
01355,continuation,Late night talk shows are mostly biased and offer one opinion.
01356,elaboration,The commentary tends to be heavily slanted toward the Left.
01357,joking_sarcastic,I suppose it is better to laugh at the state of the world than to feel like sobbing hysterically though.
01358,change,How do you get news?
01359,continuation,"That's true. It's all news, all the time."
01360,elaboration,"Yeah, I miss when I could escape the news cycle. I miss being able to joke about irrelevant things to real life."
01361,joking_sarcastic,No news really is good news.
01362,change,"Personally, I have no problem with getting your news with a dose of entertainment, but I prefer to get my news from Vloggers instead. Their opinions seem more real to me. I just feel like I'm able to relate to them somehow, you know?"
01363,continuation,It's all about having someone regurgitate the day's topics that everyone who has already glanced at trending news section anywhere on the internet has already heard.
01364,elaboration,"No one seems to care about humor, or celebrities anymore. It's not about watching interesting interviews, or hearing neat little anecdotes. People just want to dose off while feeling like they're informed about stuff."
01365,joking_sarcastic,"I mean, I could watch a serious, in-depth program about the news like Frontline for free on PBS, or I could watch highlights from last night's monologue by Jimmy ""Everyone In Late Night TV Is Named Jimmy"" Bland-Middle-America so I have something to talk about with my coworkers over lunch so I can feel like I'm in the know about things! Look at me! I'm smart and topical! Hurhurhur!"
01366,change,I like the mix of entertainment and factual content and how different hosts vary how they present the shows. But I tend to drift off to sleep halfway through! Am I the only person this happens to or do you find that as well?
01367,continuation,I like the variety of topics they cover and it's a lot more enjoyable than a static page of text.
01368,elaboration,"Plus, sometimes the hosts also interact with the audience in the studio, which I think adds something different into the mix too. And I'll sometimes learn about news stories and things I never considered, so it can really broaden your horizons."
01369,joking_sarcastic,There have been some serious nuts on TV though! Sometimes people in the audience say the craziest things. Although I'm never sure if it was deliberately done by the show producers or if these people are for real.
01370,change,"They do, but I still like to read a bit, too, to feel really informed. Speaking of reading, did you get the new ""30 Best Short Stories of the Year"" book? It's really excellent so far."
01371,continuation,"Yeah, I'll confess, I actually do get caught up on the day's news by watching the late night guys do their stuff. I feel like I'm still as informed as when I used to read the newspaper every day."
01372,elaboration,"I know, it's become a real habit for me, too. The thing is, I still know everything that's going on in the world, more or less, but I also get to laugh a little, too, and that's not the kind of perspective I've ever been able to find in a newspaper."
01373,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, and then right after the insightful and erudite exploration of China's geopolitical future, especially as it relates to past divisions both internally and across its borders, Jimmy is gonna play Paintball Pie-Fight Password with his guests, actress Kaley Cuoco, comedian Jim Gaffigan, and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. So you're all set there, news-wise."
01374,change,Maybe online news will replace both.
01375,continuation,"That's true, you get more variety on TV."
01376,elaboration,"I suppose so. You do have to wait for them to deliver it though. With the paper, you can read at your own pace."
01377,joking_sarcastic,A lot more editorializing too. I love when half the news is the anchors' personal opinions.
01378,change,It's not like there's a lot to watch late at night anyways. What else is there? Cheaters reruns? Cops? What do you watch on late night TV?
01379,continuation,"Yeah, maybe it's all phrased in the form of jokes, but you'll hear all the major news from that. And little interesting tidbits you might not hear about otherwise. What's not to love?"
01380,elaboration,"I'm not exaggerating either. I remember that there was a study that said that people who got their information from watching The Daily Show were more informed on average about what was going on than those who didn't. Sure, these shows are meant to be entertainment, but many of them truly are informative. I don't think you should look down on people simply because they digest their news differently than you."
01381,joking_sarcastic,"I mean, c'mon! Where else would I be able to laugh at a smoking baby or hear jokes about how the president is a big, dumb, dummy head! It's that kind of raw, real, observational humor that keeps people like my tuning in night after night."
01382,change,"I saw they were talking about fake news, on the real news, odd right? Do you follow politics at all?"
01383,continuation,"They don't report on the little things, only explosive topics!"
01384,elaboration,"They report on high level news, worth ratings. They don't go into the details of your local area and things that could hit home more."
01385,joking_sarcastic,"Ha! They report on anything, including the Kardashians."
01386,change,What about internet news?
01387,continuation,"Yeah, news happens throughout the day and TV gets it before the paper can."
01388,elaboration,"Yeah, TV news can just report a lot faster. I can see how it overtook the newspaper so quickly."
01389,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, I love hen 50% of the news is some anchor's personal soapbox."
01390,change,But I guess people can't help themselves. I'm not one to judge. I like candy too much. I just devoured a big bag of chocolate bars the other day. They weren't even my favorite kind. Do you have a favorite candy?
01391,continuation,"People just lack the discipline to do what's right. They should get their news from real sources, and eat their dinner before their dessert, but for some people it seems like even that's too much to ask of them."
01392,elaboration,"But I get it. It's hard to sit and watch a dreary news show when you an get the same information from a fun source instead. Who can blame people for choosing the one that's going to entertain them more? Like with my example about the dessert before dinner, sometimes the temptation is too hard to ignore, you know?"
01393,joking_sarcastic,"Of course, when your dessert is a big bowl of ice cream, and your dinner is a chocolate cake it probably doesn't matter what order you eat them in. And the doctors wonder why my blood is so thick and syrupy."
01394,change,Maybe online news is a better source?
01395,continuation,"Huh, that's true. TV news really isn't very good."
01396,elaboration,"Great analogy, yeah. TV news is way more sensational and overblown, which is why it's so popular."
01397,joking_sarcastic,"I dunno, I haven't bitten an anchor in awhile, so I don't know how good they taste."
01398,change,I suppose. But all I want to do most of the time is forget about the news -- which is always frightening and depressing -- and think about happy things. It just becomes so overwhelming otherwise.
01399,continuation,"That's true, I suppose. It's just easier to deal with all the insanity, I think, when it can be delivered with some levity as opposed to page after page of the depressing newspaper doom and gloom."
01400,elaboration,"We do, but I think the best thing is when you can have both, when the shows can be fun and funny, but they can also be smart and thought-provoking. You can make a much stronger impression on somebody by drawing them in with wit and wisdom, as opposed to sensationalism or scandal."
01401,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, yes, oh, wise one. Truer words have rarely been spoken. Much like dessert before dinner, however, they're making me cramp up a little bit."
01402,change,What about the Greeks? What would THEY think?
01403,continuation,They'd either be proud or horrified.
01404,elaboration,The ancient Romans would be too freaked out by TV and computers to worry about that.
01405,joking_sarcastic,"Yes, I'd hate to disappoint the fair and just people that were the ancient Romans."
01406,change,"I understand, though, the government isn't very good at making bread."
01407,continuation,I suppose that's a topic that might be covered in archaeological news.
01408,elaboration,"For example, the history channel has some news programs."
01409,joking_sarcastic,Or you could just go ask a modern Roman.
01410,change,"Do you think the fact we like our news to be sarcastic, at least at night, is sort of a bad mark on us as a generation? I mean I like comedy. And I like news, but should they really be together?"
01411,continuation,"I am sure they would be really confused. I like that we can get news with a sarcastic twist. We can bake our bread without interference, no rulers telling us how much or how, and no one controlling our entertainment."
01412,elaboration,"I think it is really weird to imagine ancients seeing the freedom we do not even understand. Like, we can bake our bread with no one coming to take it. Have our new delivered with out censorship. Do what we want, for the most part, and never have anyone stop us. I am sure they would be amazed."
01413,joking_sarcastic,"Just think how amazed they would be by it all ""Bread!Circuses! But where is Caligula!"". Let alone the fact that we get our news through jokes. I am sure just about every Cesar would of had either of the Jimmy's late night show hosts drawn and cut up."
01414,change,"It's not even good humor. If you want to see real humor, I suggest going to the movies. Have you seen any good comedies lately?"
01415,continuation,"I understand that people like their comedy to be topical, but I think it's too much. What ever happened to absurdist stylings? Or just being funny to be funny?"
01416,elaboration,"People want to laugh, but they also want to feel smart. They want to feel like they're learning, and being informed. So they kill two birds with one stone, even if most of these late night TV shows aren't good examples of news or humor."
01417,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe this is just the start. Maybe everything will be a joke? Maybe we'll wake up one day and find out that the president has ordered a nuclear first strike 'cause he thought it was funny. At least the late night comedians would be out of a job then. Not just because everything would be one big joke, but 'cause, you know... They'd be dead."
01418,change,"Speaking of comedy, do you ever watch the stand up comedians on the Comedy Channel?  That is some good funny stuff."
01419,continuation,"Yes, I totally agree.  You really dont see many newspapers around like you used to.  I always loved reading the comics out of the newspapers, I sure do miss them.  Did you ever  enjoy reading them?"
01420,elaboration,Are there any of these types of shows on late night TV that you watch regularly?  Personally I love Jimmy Kimmel.  It does have some news but is funny at the same time.
01421,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, gone are the days of running to the newspaper to get the comic section first before your brothers or sisters, while your parents read the paper practically page to page!"
01422,change,Online comics are doing well too.
01423,continuation,That's not a bad analysis.
01424,elaboration,"Heh, maybe we need more comedy today than ever before. Gotta laugh at the absurdity of these dark times."
01425,joking_sarcastic,Charlie Brown just isn't enough to get us through the current administration.
01426,change,So which comedian do you like best and who do you think has the most originality?
01427,continuation,They will have to come up with their own stuff and that might be hard for some.
01428,elaboration,Maybe they don't steal as much as we think they do anyway.
01429,joking_sarcastic,Right because they're so original and their ideas are so groundbreaking.
01430,change,What about online comedians on Youtube?
01431,continuation,"Nah, they'll always have things to make fun of. Comedy will live for years to come."
01432,elaboration,"I disagree. Even if TV news dies, comedy will not. Comedy will always find things to riff off."
01433,joking_sarcastic,Oh no! Maybe we DO need TV news after all!
01434,change,I'd rather spend my time playing video games than getting the news anyway.
01435,continuation,I don't think comedians really get their jokes from newspaper reporting though.
01436,elaboration,Comedians tend to find more material from video of politicians than newspaper quotes.
01437,joking_sarcastic,Of course lately most comedians are probably have to compete with the hilarity of the politicians themselves.
01438,change,Tourists can have a positive effect on the economy of a place but too much tourism can ruin places by causing them to become too commercial.
01439,continuation,Tourists are the main contributors to the economy in a lot of places.
01440,elaboration,"I enjoy going to places and doing things that the tourists don't do, I find it is much more interesting."
01441,joking_sarcastic,Sometimes when I travel I feel like it is so obvious that I am a tourist!
01442,change,"Yeah, I wonder who contributes more: Tourists or locals."
01443,continuation,"Yeah, they can add a lot of money to the local businesses."
01444,elaboration,"Yeah, tourism is a thriving industry around here. We really need it."
01445,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, I imagine the tacky souvineer shops wouldn't do as well with the locals."
01446,change,"You would think manufacturing would provide most of the driving power behind the economy. But I guess those jobs are leaving due to automation. Robots really are the future. Maybe we'll even see people getting robot pets, or marrying robots, huh?"
01447,continuation,"They go to a few stores, stay in a few hotels, eat a few restaurants, and bam, somehow they're the driving force behind the entire economy."
01448,elaboration,"It's crazy to think that a bunch of people who don't even live in the area, who may not even speak the language, somehow provide for everyone who lives there. Without these visitors, who will never stay for long, and truly appreciate the way of life for the people who live there, everything would go belly-up and the locals would have to move."
01449,joking_sarcastic,"Tourists really do have all the power since they run the whole economy. They ought to demand ought to demand the royal treatment! ""Bring me your best wine and virgins, for I am your new god for the next two weeks, and a couple hours before I have to leave for the airport!"""
01450,change,What is a baby bigfoot called? A littlefoot?
01451,continuation,"Yeah, I hate that!"
01452,elaboration,"Oh yeah, and you can't snap a photo as proof because it's in the restroom. That'd be creepy."
01453,joking_sarcastic,I think running into bigfoot anywhere is bad news.
01454,change,So do you believe in Bigfoot or is that just an excuse not to travel?
01455,continuation,"I find that when I travel, such things don't happen to me."
01456,elaboration,I tend to have more trouble with people cracking gum in my ear on planes and busses.
01457,joking_sarcastic,Or sometimes there's a delay on the tarmac due to gremlins on the wing.
01458,change,But at least in restrooms like that you don't have mice. Back at my house I have a terrible mouse problem. They've dug underneath the tub and seem to have made a nest or something there. Do you know a good way to get rid of mice?
01459,continuation,"And the smell man, ugh. You don't want to go in there next, but you don't have a choice. It's either there or the bushes. Some days just aren't the best."
01460,elaboration,"Of course, I don't mean an actual bigfoot, but a big, hairy guy who somehow takes up the whole stall. First you have to wait for him to get done, and then there's that awkward moment where your eyes meet. The whole thing is just weird. I hate it."
01461,joking_sarcastic,"Of course, I mean an actual bigfoot. A big, hairy sasquatch who somehow exists and is using a stall. First you have to wait for him to get done, and then there's that awkward moment where your human eyes meet his monkey ones. The whole thing is just weird. I hate it. But also, I love it."
01462,change,But I'd really rather visit a foreign country now that I think about it.
01463,continuation,Thew newer parks tend to be less crowded as well.
01464,elaboration,People know more about the old parks and tend to plan trips there.
01465,joking_sarcastic,I'm looking forward to the new park with the Bushes faces instead of those old guys on Mount Rushmore.
01466,change,Visiting cities is fun too.
01467,continuation,"Yeah, national parks are really relaxing places to see."
01468,elaboration,"Yeah, I love the beauty of the outdoors. I could stay out there forever and be perfectly content."
01469,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, I love big open fields without wifi."
01470,change,"National parks are great, I also enjoy finding smaller and less popular parks to visit."
01471,continuation,"I love national parks too, have you been to Yosemite?"
01472,elaboration,Which national park is your absolute favorite?
01473,joking_sarcastic,Beautiful landscapes are great but sometimes I'm afraid of getting too up close and personal with some of the animals!
01474,change,I wonder if  there are any old  crashed ships in the area
01475,continuation,I wonder if we would  see  a  pirate burying  the  treasure .
01476,elaboration,I wonder how many  different  resorts    are  there  for  us  to  visit
01477,joking_sarcastic,It would be  cool if  we opened up the pirate  chest  and  captain jack  popped out
01478,change,Maybe thee's some buried in Jamaica too.
01479,continuation,That'd be cool! I'd love to find some.
01480,elaboration,"Yeah, finding some buried booty would be exciting!"
01481,joking_sarcastic,I think the only piracy going on in resorts is of the software variety.
01482,change,"Speaking of the Caribbean, have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie? They're saying it's the last one, but I've heard that before. What do you think? Will this be the final movie in the franchise?"
01483,continuation,Or any coins on the beach? Or any shipwrecks we can visit? Or should we just stop at a gift shop on the way back?
01484,elaboration,Do you think that there's anything we can discover for ourselves and take back? Just something unique that we find for ourselves. Do you think there'll be anything like that?
01485,joking_sarcastic,"Once we find it you can call me Black Butt the pirate, because I never wipe. Why, my mateys walk the plank just to get away from my horrid stench, arg! My pet parrot is a dung beetle! I'm so uncleanly, Davy Jones hid in his gross, sweaty gym locker because it was cleaner!"
01486,change,Where do you like to go?
01487,continuation,That's a beautiful simile.
01488,elaboration,"Of course, you need to fly back to your normal life too. It's important to not forget about."
01489,joking_sarcastic,"If I had wings, I'd probably just show off with them and become rich. Then go on vacation all the time."
01490,change,"Although, there is something to be said for just taking time off and exploring what is right around you. I like that too sometimes."
01491,continuation,"Yes, it definitely takes one away from normal life and opens up all sorts of possibilities to learn and grow. I think I like travel that encompasses the most opportunities to do something different."
01492,elaboration,There are just so many opportunities these days to do different types of travelling. You can do active oriented trips or cultural tours; get really involved in the local scene or just be a passive onlooker.
01493,joking_sarcastic,Or in can be like growing roots and getting in touch with your subnormal nightmares.
01494,change,"But speaking of getting away to places, I've been meaning to get down to the store and buy some new clothes. I've been wearing the same stuff for years, and it's time I got something new. What do you think I should get? IS there anything particular in style right now?"
01495,continuation,"You get to go somewhere else, be someone else, and just enjoy yourself. It's the greatest feeling in the world."
01496,elaboration,"Everyone needs a break from the stresses and monotony of everyday life. When you travel, for a brief moment you can push worries of your life away pretend you have no responsibilities."
01497,joking_sarcastic,"It's like being an angel! Or in my case, a demon, since when I travel I always get my fun from going around and sabotaging everyone else's enjoyment and just being a huge ass! I actually have a devil I wear and everything. We should vacation together, I'll show you."
01498,change,"There probably are relaxing places to travel to, though..."
01499,continuation,"Yeah, relaxing is nice. Traveling can be a source of stress."
01500,elaboration,That's fair. You don't have time to sit down and chill out when you're constantly moving.
01501,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, excitement is so terrible!"
01502,change,So when is the next time you plan to vacation anyway? Maybe we could plan something together.
01503,continuation,All that excitement can be fun but also tiring. We're not all cut out for all that hussle and bustle.
01504,elaboration,"My favorite travel destinations offer fun but also relaxation if I need that. Maybe there's an amusement park with crazy rides but also a nice, calming, relaxing hot tub at the hotel or somewhere else where I can unwind."
01505,joking_sarcastic,"We're both some real party animals. I mean, we might read a book or drink a nice cup of tea at the end of the day on our vacation. We really tear it up."
01506,change,What do you do for the Holidays if you don't travel home?
01507,continuation,It can be a hassle to get everything done on time so you're ready to go.
01508,elaboration,But there are lots of things to help you get organized and make your trips easy now.
01509,joking_sarcastic,I think hiring someone else to take the trip for you might be your preferred method though.
01510,change,Where do you want to travel to most?
01511,continuation,"Yeah, all those things are great."
01512,elaboration,"Yeah, I'd love to travel too. I want to see the world! All of it!"
01513,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, nothing like jet lag to make me excited!"
01514,change,I would love to be able to move somewhere different sometimes and just escape it all.
01515,continuation,"If you are having a stressful time and you need to get away, it's great to be able to travel to a diverse location."
01516,elaboration,"If I am going to travel, I will immediately book a hotel online and begin to pack the same day. I don't waste much time. I will buy more things when I get there."
01517,joking_sarcastic,"When I am upset about something and I need to get away, it would be nice to not have to tell anyone where I am going."
01518,change,We did quite a bit of hiking while on the islands.
01519,continuation,What is your favorite place that you've ever traveled to?
01520,elaboration,I would have to say mine is Hawaii.  Specifically the island of Kauai.
01521,joking_sarcastic,"I've been to Oahu too, but hasn't everybody."
01522,change,"You're being too hard on yourself. I don't think you have a boring life at all. But before you get all depressed, why don't we go get a couple of drinks and then choose a place for dinner?"
01523,continuation,"I don't think so. I mean, if you're traveling places a lot of the time, then your life wouldn't really be boring, would it? It would be filled with exciting trips all over the place."
01524,elaboration,"Oh, I don't know. That's for analytical minds like yours to ponder over. I just want to enjoy myself and see everything we can see here in the few days we have. I'm really in heaven right now."
01525,joking_sarcastic,"Well, I don't exactly think my life is boring, to be honest. But I'll tell you what I do think is true. I sincerely believe that, in general, a travel companion's potential to be annoying is directly related to how likely it is that travel companion will be spending the rest of the trip by himself."
01526,change,How have you been? Have you decided on any place new this year to go?
01527,continuation,Perhaps. Going back and forth to the same places everyday does get kind of boring. Going new places breaks that up.
01528,elaboration,Sometimes getting stuck in a routine can make like seem so boring and short. Travel helps with change and makes everything better!
01529,joking_sarcastic,"I wouldn't say so, I tend to take the spouse and kids with me!"
01530,change,"Of course, fun-loving people could just be easily bored."
01531,continuation,Maybe that's true. My normal life is a bit dull.
01532,elaboration,It could be. I can see how people might want to escape the monotony of everyday stress.
01533,joking_sarcastic,"If that's the case, then I want to travel all the time!"
01534,change,Canada might be fun to visit too.
01535,continuation,"Yeah, Europe sounds like a fun place to go to."
01536,elaboration,"Europe has so many places to see: The UK, Italy, Germany... So much history!"
01537,joking_sarcastic,You mean random and nonsensical? Because that's how my dreams tend to be.
01538,change,Have you visited South America?  It is also an amazing trip to take.
01539,continuation,"Europe is amazing my favorite European city is Paris, you would love it there."
01540,elaboration,I love visiting Europe but my favorite destination spot is definitely Australia.
01541,joking_sarcastic,Europe is a dream that I never want to wake up from!
01542,change,But I'd really like to travel to China.
01543,continuation,"I really enjoyed my time there, myself."
01544,elaboration,Germany was probably the most beautiful place I have seen
01545,joking_sarcastic,Of course it's probably prettier in Middle Earth.
01546,change,What about London or Munich?
01547,continuation,Why not? I bet it's beautiful.
01548,elaboration,Paris is a lovely place with a rich history. I'd love to visit.
01549,joking_sarcastic,What? Not a fan of baguettes?
01550,change,What about going to Florida also
01551,continuation,Either have I. I've always wanted to see the Eiffel tower
01552,elaboration,I bet you Paris looks really nice this time of year
01553,joking_sarcastic,Can't beat the french. I just hope I don't see woman who don't have shaved armpits
01554,change,I like visiting new parks and museums.
01555,continuation,Especially places with good food.
01556,elaboration,"Me too, except I want to stay away from the Middle East."
01557,joking_sarcastic,And those places love new visitors like you.
01558,change,Where do you like to travel to?
01559,continuation,"It's good, but it's not the ONLY thing."
01560,elaboration,I wouldn't say that. There's a lot of fun you can have at home.
01561,joking_sarcastic,"If it's the only thing, are we constantly moving?"
01562,change,"I can't even tell you all the amazing places I've visited. Some of them aren't even real. I've been into VR lately, and using it to visit virtual destinations. Have you tried VR yet?"
01563,continuation,"I love going to new places, seeing new people, trying new foods. The entire experience is what makes life worth living. I don't know how I'd get by without travel."
01564,elaboration,"It's always been my lifelong goal to travel the world. It's basically my biggest aspiration. To travel to every continent, excluding Antarctica of course. I want to visit all the major cities in the world, and lots of small hidden locations too. I guess I just want to see it all, and experience everything."
01565,joking_sarcastic,"The moment I get too old to travel I will literally die then and there. I will just fall over dead, so that I can travel to my next and final destination. I wonder where I'll end up. Guess I'll still have one surprise to look forward to!"
01566,change,"How about quick weekend trips, sometimes they satisfy my travel bug and they aren't too expensive."
01567,continuation,"My favorite place so far has been a trip to Italy, have you ever been?"
01568,elaboration,"My next trip will be an African safari, I am leaving next month and am so excited."
01569,joking_sarcastic,Well it's the best thing by far....too bad we have to work!
01570,change,"It IS tempting, isn't it? But everything seems nicer on vacation versus if you lived here, worked here and...oh, that reminds me. Did you call your boss yet? I don't want him to think I didn't give you the message."
01571,continuation,"I know, I completely agree with you. Honestly, who wouldn't love the history and the culture and the diversity? It's so amazing compared to our dull, dreary town. Every day of this trip, I feel more and more like I want to stay here."
01572,elaboration,"That's how I feel, too. The hardest thing would be to decide where in Europe you'd want to settle down. Could you imagine life in France? Or Italy maybe? If you could learn the language without too much trouble, it could be amazing."
01573,joking_sarcastic,"Well, me probably. I love visiting, but moving here? I think I'd prefer a place where I could actually communicate with people who actually speak my language and vice versa. Otherwise, I get tired of the pantomiming pretty quickly. You, however, not so much, apparently."
01574,change,Do you think you could ever live in Asia?
01575,continuation,"I don't know if I would want to live there.  I like to travel, but I also like coming back home."
01576,elaboration,"I think I would like living in Italy the most.  The food, the history, and the people are all so interesting to me."
01577,joking_sarcastic,The Europeans that come to America?
01578,change,I'm debating whether to go on a river cruise for my next vacation.  Have you heard anything about them?
01579,continuation,"I visited Italy, Spain and France during my latest trip and loved all three"
01580,elaboration,Europeans have a different attitude toward life compared to Americans - they really enjoy life and work to live not the other way around
01581,joking_sarcastic,If I were living in Europe I would gain 100 pounds from all the delicious food and wine but would at least die a happy man
01582,change,"Do you think it is trespassing if at some point they said you could swim there? Like the neighbor said, ""Hey come swimming this weekend"", just the time you went they did not know?"
01583,continuation,The beach is a really nice place to be reminded of visiting. Skinny dipping? Like naked? Not in public.
01584,elaboration,"I have in a pool before, I did not get caught skinny dipping though.  I was in a pool."
01585,joking_sarcastic,I may have went skinny dipping in some one elses pool.
01586,change,"Now what about streaking? If you like to get naked, it doesn't have to be in the water."
01587,continuation,I like to skinny dip when there's no one around. Does that count? Or do you have to do it when there are other people with you?
01588,elaboration,"I have to be with people I really trust. I like to go way out into a lake, where you can't touch the bottom, and take off my swimsuit. The water all over, with no cloth in between it and my body, is really sensuous."
01589,joking_sarcastic,I always worry about what I'd do if I got so carried away I let go of my bathing suit! Or if a fish comes up and nibbles my privates. Neither of those has happened yet.
01590,change,I like swimming in a pool most. I grew up with pools and have spent a lot of time in them.
01591,continuation,"I have. It's lots of fun, especially with a partner. Though it's more fun in a pool."
01592,elaboration,I like swimming because of how free you can feel.
01593,joking_sarcastic,I just don't like the ocean because I don't want to get bitten by anything on my undercarage.
01594,change,Do you know where we could go to get good chilli dogs
01595,continuation,I love the smell of the beach
01596,elaboration,The smell of the beach reminds me of back home in florida
01597,joking_sarcastic,Just make sure you wash your car after to get the smell out
01598,change,Well at least you got to do some meditation at the beach.
01599,continuation,Yeah unless you got stung by a Jellyfish like I did last time I went to the beach.
01600,elaboration,"Oh wow, did it hurt when you got stung?"
01601,joking_sarcastic,What do you think? It was so painful I had to lie down for fifteen minutes and concentrate on breathing.
01602,change,My favorite sunscreen is coppertone. Banana boat smells fake to me.
01603,continuation,The smell of the beach is wonderful. Especially with sunscreen like coppertone.
01604,elaboration,I don't like the way my skin feels after being at the beach though. Your skin feels all stiff from the salt.
01605,joking_sarcastic,I hate sand though. It gets into all of your cracks.
01606,change,"My favorite activity after going to the beach is to take a long hot bath. Though I don't get the opportunity often, there's something relaxing about baths."
01607,continuation,"I agree. I hate leaving the beach as well. Not only do you have the thought of a fun time that's now over, you've got a hole bunch of cleaning up to do."
01608,elaboration,And the way that it gets into your ears and eyes. Nothing takes longer than a post beach shower.
01609,joking_sarcastic,It's like you're wearing a beach by the time you get home.
01610,change,"I've been thinking about Vacation this year, do you plan on taking one? If so, where you going?"
01611,continuation,"Yes, it can be a pain. That's one of the most annoying things ever."
01612,elaboration,"I remember two years ago we went to Virginia Beach, and we had sand in our car for six months after that."
01613,joking_sarcastic,I thought we brought half the beach back with us.
01614,change,"Yeah but speaking of sand, there's something so comforting about it. It reminds me of visiting Florida to see my grandma as a kid."
01615,continuation,"I completely understand, it is a total pain. Especially if your kids join you!"
01616,elaboration,"Right, there's nothing fun about cleaning out the car after the beach, but maybe it'd be a good idea to rinse off as best as we can before getting in and lay down towels over the seats?"
01617,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, no, you're not being a pessimist at all by complaining nonstop."
01618,change,Traveling to the desert has quite a similar problem. The sand gets into everything.
01619,continuation,The way that the salt eats away at your car and all the cleaning you have to do of the seats and the carpets makes you wonder.
01620,elaboration,You even find sand in your ears! By the time you've beaten half the Atlantic out of your bag the beach doesn't seem like such a good idea.
01621,joking_sarcastic,At least if you brought the fish with you you got to have some sushi.
01622,change,What happened to the backyard. Did your dog dig a hole again
01623,continuation,Ha that's funny. I have done that brought the beach home with me
01624,elaboration,Just two weeks ago I brought home a few shells
01625,joking_sarcastic,You could have a beach party
01626,change,"Speaking of front doors, mine totally got a huge crack in it the other night. I don't know if someone threw a rock at it or what but UGH!"
01627,continuation,"Ha ha ha! That's fantastic, I'll bring the kids by your house later."
01628,elaboration,"When I opened MY car door, a tidal wave attacked me and a whale fell on top of me. It took me five hours to get someone's attention so they could help me out."
01629,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, there's a beach at my house too. A female dog."
01630,change,"Do you know where the new mal, is going to be"
01631,continuation,That sounds awesome. What kind of car?
01632,elaboration,Ive had my convertable for 5 years
01633,joking_sarcastic,Hey you wont have to constantly wait for your car to heat up
01634,change,Even buying a motorcycle isn't as simple as it used to be.
01635,continuation,Buying a new car is difficult these days with so many new and pre-owned options.
01636,elaboration,My family has always traded classic cars and I've seen a hundred deals and still it feels intimidating to purchase one.
01637,joking_sarcastic,It feels like the fast talking salesmen are always trying to get me to buy something I didn't think I wanted.
01638,change,I think it won't be too much longer until we can all get self-driving functionality in our cars.
01639,continuation,"I'd like to get a new car, but I need to coax a few more years out of the one I've got to make it worth what I paid for it."
01640,elaboration,"I like having a new car, but I hate shopping for them, and I especially hate dealing with the sales people."
01641,joking_sarcastic,If you get a sweet dune buggy you could use it at the beach.
01642,change,"Hey, I found a gold coin once while walking on the beach."
01643,continuation,My favorite time to walk the beach is early in the morning.
01644,elaboration,"Yes, because you have the beach and the ocean seemingly to yourself."
01645,joking_sarcastic,"Well, I can't afford a cheeseburger but I guess I can own the whole ocean!"
01646,change,"How about sand, anyway? Have you ever played with that kinetic sand stuff?"
01647,continuation,"Right, definitely. It's the gift that keeps on giving as you clean you car year after year!"
01648,elaboration,"Yeah and you get to take with some nice blisters, beach hair, dirty sandals,..."
01649,joking_sarcastic,Perhaps you mean the bitch?
01650,change,"When winter comes, you can decorate your backyard to look like a ski resort! No sand required for that."
01651,continuation,You can also take shells and driftwood. Decorate your entire car like the beach.
01652,elaboration,If you get enough stuff you could even use it to make a beach scene in your backyard. Just don't take anything illegal. In some places it's illegal to take seashells.
01653,joking_sarcastic,Just don't go so far as to get cutouts of Gidget or the Beach Blanket Bingo movies for your set-up. That would be silly.
01654,change,"Although this time of year, getting stuff in your eye can be a big problem. Do you suffer from hay fever? Pollen, now that's a killer. And I'll be there's more pollen in this world than grains of sand."
01655,continuation,"Even small amounts can fell like a lot, though. For example, in your underpants."
01656,elaboration,"Although there are certainly large amounts of sand in certain parts of the world: take the Sahara Desert, for example."
01657,joking_sarcastic,I wouldn't want to get the Sahara Desert in my eye.
01658,change,Standing in the surfe with the water lapping over your feet is relaxing as well.
01659,continuation,If you dry it it hardens. I used to build a lot of sand castles  with hard sand. Digging in the sand was a lot of fun as a child.
01660,elaboration,I don't like it when people dig holes and don't fill them in though. They're a great way to sprain your ankle.
01661,joking_sarcastic,In the sand is also a nice place to get romantic.
01662,change,Do you know when John is coming over for dinner
01663,continuation,Yes I have got sand in a few unmentionables
01664,elaboration,I went to the beach on saturday. There was this kid who built an amazing sand castle
01665,joking_sarcastic,Heck getting sand in your feet is the best part
01666,change,"Talking about vacuuming the car, I hate having to clean the car. Some people find the experience ccalming, I can't stand having to do it."
01667,continuation,I also love having to beat the sand out of bags and blankets. It almost makes it seem like it's not worth it.
01668,elaboration,"Every time I'm standing on the beach at sunset though, I see why people do it. Even with the sand in your stuff and on your clothes it's still a magical experience."
01669,joking_sarcastic,"Unless it's raining, then there's I'd rather be anywhere else. Being hit with windy sand hurts!"
01670,change,Do you know anybody who has a backyard pool? I wonder how much they cost. Would save on gas money and time not having to drive to the beach on those hot days.
01671,continuation,"Especially if you have kids, you're vacuuming almost every day."
01672,elaboration,"But my kids love the beach, and the back seat gets filled with buckets and shovels and inflatable water toys. It's not just sand."
01673,joking_sarcastic,Maybe I should install a backyard pool! They won't want to put that in the back seat of the car!
01674,change,Vacuuming is a hassle. But at least you can't hear your screaming kids!
01675,continuation,"I love vacuuming my car too, haha, but it's worth it for all the fun we've had."
01676,elaboration,"Right, plus it's so fun given all the nice blisters, beach hair, sweat,..."
01677,joking_sarcastic,"Right, me too! I especially love that the sand never truly goes away even after years!"
01678,change,Do you know when Dave is getting home
01679,continuation,Me too I have gone to Lake Ontario a few times
01680,elaboration,The beach reminds me of a peaceful place
01681,joking_sarcastic,I wouldn't imagine getting sand in your shoes is very comfortable. But that's all part of the beach experience
01682,change,"Actually, lakes can have some weird stuff in them. Have you ever stepped on anything squirmy in the lake? I hear they've got eels and bloodsuckers, icky."
01683,continuation,I actually prefer lakes to the ocean. Salt water makes you feel so sticky when you dry off.
01684,elaboration,"You can do a lot of the same things in a lake as in the ocean, except maybe surfing. If the lake is big enough, you can go sail boating, and they have these new boards now you can stand on and paddle your way around."
01685,joking_sarcastic,No need to worry about sharks in a lake! Unless you go to Loch Ness; watch out for the Loch Ness monster!
01686,change,"I know it's kind of silly, but I really enjoy watching those shows about people who hunt for lake monsters."
01687,continuation,"Lakes are pretty nice, especially if you can go out on a boat."
01688,elaboration,Lakes always remind me of the times my Dad took me fishing.
01689,joking_sarcastic,You like lakes? I like lakes. Have you ever had the luck to eat leeks at a lake?
01690,change,I prefer the ocean though. There's something magical about the cool water.
01691,continuation,The only thing I don't really like is the sand.
01692,elaboration,I've been going to the beach since I was very young.
01693,joking_sarcastic,The beach is best with a bucket of beer.
01694,change,"I like the sound of flowing water, but I prefer a fountain or a babbling brook."
01695,continuation,"The sound of the surf is nice, there's a reason they use it for those machines that play relaxation sounds."
01696,elaboration,"I do like the sounds at the beach, the surf but also the wind and seagulls, too."
01697,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, ""Those waves are gnarly, dude."" No, wait, that's the sound of the surfers."
01698,change,Speaking of sound have you tried holding a shell to your ear?
01699,continuation,Oh the sound is so delightful especially when taking a nap.
01700,elaboration,Well the surf actually helps keep the sand nice and clean.
01701,joking_sarcastic,Really? All there is to love and that's what you choose?
01702,change,Was it sunny when you went to the beach
01703,continuation,I once got pooped on by a seagul
01704,elaboration,Those creatures are so discusting
01705,joking_sarcastic,Hope you were able to get it out
01706,change,"Stepping on sea shells is another hazard at the beach. If you get your foot cut, always remember to disinfect it since open wounds can pick up infections at the beach."
01707,continuation,Nothing is worse than having your food stolen by sea gulls.
01708,elaboration,The sand feels good as it squishes between your toes.
01709,joking_sarcastic,A seagull stole my entire sandwich one day and then pooped on me afterwards!
01710,change,"Sometimes it creeps me out a little to think about all the fish pooping in the water, where it all mixes together so you can't even step around it."
01711,continuation,"And as luck would have it, you usually get to bring some of that home on your car, too."
01712,elaboration,"And when they're not pooping they're eating garbage, so they're kind of disgusting at both ends."
01713,joking_sarcastic,"People are always trying to say how beautiful and majestic nature is, but I estimate that it's about 30% poop."
01714,change,Maybe I should build the kids a tree house. We've got a big tree in the back yard with some nice large low-hanging branches. How hard do you think that would be?
01715,continuation,"Ain't that the truth! You know, I thought about making a sandbox in the back yard. Of course, I'd have to buy the sand. If everyone took sand home from the beach to make a sandbox, there'd be no beach left!"
01716,elaboration,"I need to make this before my kids get too old and lose interest. It would be so good for them, to be outside playing in the fresh air instead of stuck inside watching TV all the time."
01717,joking_sarcastic,"However, I do have cats... and you know what cats like to do in the sandbox!"
01718,change,"Speaking of sand, do you have a sand box? I've been looking for one for the boys."
01719,continuation,"I know what you mean, we bring tons of sand back home with us every year."
01720,elaboration,"I tried vacuuming it out last year, but that stuff gets everywhere."
01721,joking_sarcastic,"We had so much sand in the van, it was flying in my eyes driving home."
01722,change,Fishing is a unique beach experience because you can directly profit from your work.
01723,continuation,If you want to make a unique planter you can fil a pot with sand and seashells.
01724,elaboration,Collecting sea shells is another exciting activity at the beach.
01725,joking_sarcastic,I'm not sure the environmentalists agree with me but collecting pretty sea shells has always been fun.
01726,change,I like water parks too.  Have you ever bee to one?  I think they are a lot of fun even though I did have a scary experience at one growing up.
01727,continuation,Hmm.  I'm not sure if it's technically trespassing or not.  It sure seems like a good way to make your neighbor mad though.  It would probably be the last time they invited you to swim.
01728,elaboration,I'm not sure.  A bunch of us tried to go swimming in a hotel pool that we weren't staying at once.  We got ran off by staff pretty quickly by hotel staff. Apparently there are all kids of liability issues.  I imagine there are liability issues for homeowners too.
01729,joking_sarcastic,Ha Ha.  I guess I need to be very specific when I give you an invitation.  I'll be keeping a closer eye on you from now on.
01730,change,I enjoy swimming in lakes and all the activities that you can do in a lake. I have many fond memories of jumping on water trampolines over a lake when I was young.
01731,continuation,It's a lot of fun. I used to be able to skinny dip in our pool since we had hedges all around our property that blocked peoples view.
01732,elaboration,It's such a freeing feeling to glide through the water and feel it sliding past your body.
01733,joking_sarcastic,"I'll tell you something though, if you're skinny dipping in a lake you better hope that you don't get bitten where the sun doesn't shine."
01734,change,I love putting bath bombs in the bath. Do you have a favorite bath bomb to use?
01735,continuation,I enjoy putting bubbles in  the bath. I think it makes it even more relaxing.
01736,elaboration,A bath is a nice thing after the beach because the beach can actually be quite a pain. After cleaning the sand off of everything you deserve to relax!
01737,joking_sarcastic,Baths are so relaxing with all the dirt from your body floating around!
01738,change,"Totally, but what do you think about the mountains? Have you ever gone hiking?"
01739,continuation,"Yes, not to mention the unpacking and laundry that has to be done too."
01740,elaboration,"I totally agree, I hate leaving the beach too. There's nothing like the beach, the sights, smells, and sounds. It's amazing."
01741,joking_sarcastic,"Or you can just throw everything away and buy all new stuff, including the sandy car!"
01742,change,Do you burn easy in the sun?
01743,continuation,The beach is my favorite place to be.
01744,elaboration,I love walking along the edge of the sand near the water. I get the sand off my feet before I go in my car.
01745,joking_sarcastic,Well you could live in your car with all the sand.
01746,change,"I don't know, I'm arguing with my family about it, so I don't even want to talk about it. What I really want to do is take a month off and work on my book. But I don't think I'm going to be able to do that. Let me tell you what I was thinking about in terms of the next chapter, though, okay?"
01747,continuation,"Oh boy, that's a good question. We've been trying to figure it out, but I'm not sure about my work schedule yet, so I don't know how much time I'm gonna have, which is going to determine where we can go. So I don't know, which is driving me crazy a little bit, to be honest."
01748,elaboration,"I'm definitely going to take one. I get a little stir crazy if I don't. Last year, when it got to be around this time of year, I found myself getting so tense all the time, and it finally occurred to me that I was long overdue for some time off. It was affecting my mood in a really significant way."
01749,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, I'm scheduling a trip around the world even as we speak. The only thing standing in the way is the fact that I've already used all my vacation days for my brother's stupid wedding, so no, my round-the-world trip is canceled, thanks for bringing it up."
01750,change,I do adore the beach but I also like a nice serene lake.  Do you like lakes or are you just a beach person?
01751,continuation,"I know what you mean, you can clean your car forever and the sand just won't come out.  I have found that the best thing to do is try a commercial vacuum at the car wash.  Have you tried that?"
01752,elaboration,"I love Virginia Beach and have been there many time  My favorite beaches on the East Coast are up north in Cape Cod, those beaches are beautiful."
01753,joking_sarcastic,"I know what you mean, I swear sand seems to multiply once it gets in the car!"
01754,change,"I also like to visit the towns along Lake Michigan, they lake is so big it reminds me of the ocean."
01755,continuation,"That must have been a lot of fun visiting your grandma, what else did you guys do besides go to the beach?"
01756,elaboration,I really like to walk on the beach and find interesting shells and rocks.
01757,joking_sarcastic,That sand on your feet is good for exfoliating your feet!
01758,change,That's why I prefer getting onto the ocean from a dock. As long as I don't have to get sandy I'm happy.
01759,continuation,Nothing is worse than getting salt water in the seats.
01760,elaboration,It always ends up making the car smelly because it soaks in and it's difficult to get out. If it's really bad you might just have to get the interior detailed.
01761,joking_sarcastic,Isn't it terrible to go to the beach because it's free only to spend 200 dollars having your car cleaned and detailed.
01762,change,"My car has rust, I have to find a repair shop."
01763,continuation,"I do too, it is great exercise."
01764,elaboration,"A car full of sand does not remind me of a day at the beach, it reminds me that I have to go clean my car."
01765,joking_sarcastic,You can cook the fish and crabs for dinner.
01766,change,I like to watch nature films about the sea though. It's fascinating how diverse life in the water can be. I was watching recently about creatures that live completely in the dark thousands of feet below the surface.
01767,continuation,I don't like the beach for that reason. What's fun about getting dirty?
01768,elaboration,I sympathize what with all of the work that it takes and the number of days that you end up tracking sand everywhere it's just not for me.
01769,joking_sarcastic,Especially because there's so many creepy crawlies on the beach.
01770,change,What was the weather like that night?
01771,continuation,"Wow, that is awful."
01772,elaboration,"How big is the crack, what is your door made out of?"
01773,joking_sarcastic,Glass?
01774,change,I love looking for deals for everything. I got my computer so cheap because of a deal I found online!
01775,continuation,Purchasing a new car can be one of the most intimidating things.
01776,elaboration,"There are many deals when it comes to buying cars, but I think it is important to do a lot of research about what is the best deal to go with."
01777,joking_sarcastic,Sometimes it seems like buying a car is more about the deals than the actual car!
01778,change,Take a look in the local newspaper classifieds. Sometimes you can find a decent private sale and even bring it to a friend or mechanic you trust to take a close look or use a place like Carfax where you can get detailed previous ownership details.
01779,continuation,It is probably better to do the options checking for the model you like before going to the dealership.
01780,elaboration,But I understand what you mean. Before you know it a slick salesman will have you getting things that you will never use like a ski rack in southern California.
01781,joking_sarcastic,Perhaps getting a smaller car like a Barbie play car would take off the sales pressure.
01782,change,"It's kind of strange how technology turns out. Way back when they thought we'd all be controlling our own flying cars, but it turns out that we're going to have computers drive us around on the ground."
01783,continuation,"That will be pretty cool. It will be like having a chauffeur. ""Jeeves, take me to the beach!"""
01784,elaboration,"Probably. I think I'll miss driving myself once everything gets fully automated, especially out on the open road where you can really feel in control. Maybe I should get something sporty while I've still got time."
01785,joking_sarcastic,"Probably. I bet I'll still have to vacuum up the sand myself, though."
01786,change,Your wife seemed busy this afternoon.
01787,continuation,"If I take car of this new car like it should be taken care of, maybe I will not have to buy another for a long time."
01788,elaboration,I have a whole calendar of scheduled maintenance that I will need to follow up on to keep my new car healthy.
01789,joking_sarcastic,"I told my wife since i have to do all this maintenance , she is responsible for the cars education, make sure it is brought up correctly."
01790,change,I don't mind boat shopping as much though. There's just something engaging about the diversity of boat models that makes shopping for them a lot more enjoyable.
01791,continuation,The decision is always difficult because there's just so many options to choose from. I always wish I could skip the buying part and just find out what I end up picking.
01792,elaboration,I know how difficult it can be to deal with sales people. They're always trying to push you to buy something that's just out of your price range and they make every deal sound so good.
01793,joking_sarcastic,Nothing is worse than to show up at a dealership and have some man talking a million miles an hour in your face! They could ask me to trade in my first born child and I'd probably agree before I realized what they asked me.
01794,change,"Wow. That reminds me of my grandfather, he had a pretty extensive coin collection."
01795,continuation,Really? That's amazing. The most interesting thing I've ever found is cool-looking shells.
01796,elaboration,"Wow. I sometimes see people with metal detectors there, but I figured that nobody ever actually finds anything worthwhile."
01797,joking_sarcastic,"Like a pirate treasure gold coin, or one of those infomercial commemorative coins?"
01798,change,"I've never actually been to the beach before noon, but I really like to run around the lake near my house in the morning. It's good exercise, and I get in touch with nature a bit."
01799,continuation,"My favorite time to walk along the beach is at night. The sunsets make me feel so beautiful and peaceful, and since I'm an introvert, it's a good way to get some alone time."
01800,elaboration,Me too. I love to smell the fresh ocean air and hear the waves crash. It's my favorite way to begin the day when I vacation in Florida.
01801,joking_sarcastic,"I enjoy walking on the beach in the morning too. There's no people out, so I can't accidentally knock over someone's umbrella or trip over a little kid's sand castle. You know me, I'm naturally clumsy. That's something I've accidentally done."
01802,change,I enjoy traveling to the islands. The Bahamas and Caribbean are beautiful places to visit.
01803,continuation,I've always wished that I could own a private beach. I hate the crowds on the beach and the fact that you can never set up where you want.
01804,elaboration,The feeling of being alone at the beach is extremely relaxing. I often feel like none of my worldly cares matter for a few moments.
01805,joking_sarcastic,If I had my own private beach I think the best thing about it would be the chance to stride up to somebody and tell them to get off my island!
01806,change,"You totally could. Which reminds me, are you going away at Christmastime this year? I was wondering if you could dog sit for me if you're going to be in town."
01807,continuation,"I suppose you could. I've never gone quite that far, but I do love getting my house and yard all festive looking at Christmas time. I like to go overboard, to be honest."
01808,elaboration,"Sure, ski resort. Or Santa's compound type of an area. Or like Ice Station Zebra, like a remote research base in a distant frozen location. Yeah, the snow gives you a ton of options."
01809,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, gee, I guess you could. And you could always dress your garage up to look like a mental hospital and check yourself in for observation. Just make sure to tell the doctors that you like to pretend your backyard is a ski resort. They'll rush you right in, I'm sure."
01810,change,"I do love when I can take stuff home from the beach too. One beach I was at sold tropical plants we could bring home, and it was so much more authentic than a generic beach scene."
01811,continuation,"Yeah, it's hard to remember all the exact rules of each beach. But I appreciate how much beaches work to preserve their beauty, especially those in national parks."
01812,elaboration,"I wonder why exactly it's illegal. I mean, it's not like the seashells are being used anymore."
01813,joking_sarcastic,"I dropped a seashell in my bag by accident once when I was at the beach, and I panicked as I was leaving when I noticed it, and I had to frantically run and put it back. The lifeguards were laughing so hard."
01814,change,I've always been pretty comfortable giving speeches. The experience doesn't fill me with as much anxiety as it does for some people.
01815,continuation,I feel for people with allergies. It's hard to hide from something that you're allergic to when it's in the air everywhere.
01816,elaboration,It's like walking through a world of poison!
01817,joking_sarcastic,And don't you hate it when you have to give a speech and your nose is clogged and you end up sounding like donold duck?
01818,change,Breaking a bone is an unforgettable experience for sure. That's one of those pains that you just can't forget.
01819,continuation,Sometimes I'm so civic minded that I'll go ahead and fill them in. Nothing is more awkward than to be on your hands and knees as an adult covering over some childs sandcastle.
01820,elaboration,I hate spraining an ankle. I always end up doing it when walking along curbs.
01821,joking_sarcastic,Limping gives me a good excuse not to exercise though.
01822,change,I like romantic movies but I hate when I end up crying. Nothing feels more silly on a first date!
01823,continuation,Romantic evenings on the beach are a great way to feel connected and passionate. Sitting on the sand under the stars is enchanting.
01824,elaboration,Some of my best romantic memories are beach picnics.
01825,joking_sarcastic,It's unfortunate but all the fairy tale scenes that we laugh at in movies speak to us as people. I think that no matter how much you might claim that romantic movies aren't for you that everyone enjoys it when those situations actually happen.
01826,change,"It's going to rain tomorrow I heard, so they'll be gone."
01827,continuation,I have seen some talented creations made of sand that even involved seashells.
01828,elaboration,Some of them were over six feet tall.
01829,joking_sarcastic,Wouldn't want to stand too close to that one would ya.
01830,change,I prefer to take long walks on the beach with sandles. Running on the beach is a really good workout because of the resistance of the sand.
01831,continuation,It does feel warm and soft under your feet.
01832,elaboration,Don't you hate it when it gets between your toes though? And the clean up feels like it takes forever.
01833,joking_sarcastic,It's like turning into the sand monster!
01834,change,"Speaking of sunsets, have you ever seen the green flash? During perfect conditions, right before the sun completely sets, there's a bright green flash."
01835,continuation,Its one of the reasons why a lot of people get married on the beach.  The pictures are amazing: the couple's silhouette against crashing waves and white sand . . . it truly is something else.
01836,elaboration,"Not to mention being barefoot - sinking into the wet sand, makes you feel one with the earth."
01837,joking_sarcastic,You just have to make sure you don't sink too much or it's tough to get out!
01838,change,"By the way, are we still going to the  Cyndi Lauper concert next month?"
01839,continuation,Blowing up all those inflatable water toys sure can be a chore. I guess it keeps the ol' lungs healthy though and it sure beats having the kids sit in front of the tv all day.
01840,elaboration,"It does have its benefits though. We get a fabulous tan and  playing on the beach wears out the kids. By the time we get home, they are so tired and ready to hit the sack."
01841,joking_sarcastic,"You know what they say, "" Girls just want to have sun""."
01842,change,There never seems to be enough time to get away like there used to be.
01843,continuation,"For all the sand in my shoes, the sunburned noses and the smell of fish, I would pick up and go to the beach today if was possible."
01844,elaboration,My family used to spend weeks camping along one beach or another.
01845,joking_sarcastic,"During the summer I would turn feral: hair wild, face tanned dark, and the soles of my feet hard as leather."
01846,change,I love lakes and nature but I hate the cold. Nothing gets to me more than cold weather because it feels like you're freezing from the inside out.
01847,continuation,"I've always wanted to visit Canada. I hear that they have some beautiful greenery up there, and the scenery is supposed to be picturesque."
01848,elaboration,I'd love to go there in the summer to experience the beauty of the open woods but I'd hate the winters.
01849,joking_sarcastic,How don't you all freeze up there?
01850,change,"For me, the mountains make me thing of a perfect, ""happy place""."
01851,continuation,It's the same for me. The beach is a place where I can easily sit and meditate and pray.
01852,elaboration,"I feel like we can feel so rested at the beach because it calms all of our senses. We can touch the sand, hear the waves, smell the salt. All we have to do is buy a treat to eat and we have calming input coming into all of our senses!"
01853,joking_sarcastic,"See, ever since I watched Jaws, the beach isn't quite the same for me, you know?"
01854,change,How close do you live to the beach?  Is it a long drive to get there?
01855,continuation,"It is part of the whole experience, but cleaning the car can really take some time."
01856,elaboration,I love walking the beach but I also really enjoy playing in the waves.
01857,joking_sarcastic,"Sand in your shoes and a possible sunburn are part of the experience, neither of which makes it sound that fun!"
01858,change,I also like to kayak but for that I prefer the ocean.  Have you tried kayaking?
01859,continuation,"I have stepped on some weird creatures in the lake, but nothing scary enough to make me stop swimming."
01860,elaboration,I really like water skiing when I visit the lake.  It scary and fun at the same time.
01861,joking_sarcastic,I really hope I never step on an eel!  That would really freak me out.
01862,change,I love how smooth lakes are. They allow for a lot of unique water activities such as wake surfing.
01863,continuation,I have so many good memories of being out on lakes. I enjoyed extreme water sports such as wake boarding and skiing so I spent a lot of time on a ski boat on the water.
01864,elaboration,I would love to live on a lake one day.
01865,joking_sarcastic,As long as I didn't get eaten by an alligator!
01866,change,The mountains are nice too especially in the fall when the weather is nice and the leaves are changing.
01867,continuation,Paddle boards?  Those look like a lot of fun.  We should try to find some place we can rent a couple.
01868,elaboration,My favorite thing to a the lake near me is canoeing.  Every once and a while the park offers sunset canoe trips.  It is so peaceful and beautiful to be out on the lake at the end of the day.
01869,joking_sarcastic,Plus there's no chance of being eaten by JAWS.
01870,change,"Yeah, I like outdoor things in general. I'm a big fan of camping out, too. Not many people are, it seems, but I love a night in the woods in a tent, campfire, the whole nine yards."
01871,continuation,"Yeah, I like boating, too. I try and do it a lot during the summer, just go out to the lake and relax and spend time with friends or alone or whatever. Always a nice day."
01872,elaboration,"Yeah, I love boating. I just love the water in general, actually. I like boating, canoing, wake-boarding, scuba diving. Anything in the water, I'm cool with it."
01873,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, that's good thinking there. I was wondering why, when I go out without a boat, I always get drenched. That really had me stumped, but wow, I think you figured it out. You're a smart one, huh?"
01874,change,How is your Dad doing? I have not seen him in years.
01875,continuation,Fishing was more about just spending time with my Dad than about bringing in the big haul.
01876,elaboration,We would sit for hours gently rocking back and forth in a small fishing boat.
01877,joking_sarcastic,"If a fish did hit my fishing line, the shock would make me almost jump out of the boat."
01878,change,Cruises are another way to enjoy the ocean. Between the view and the free food I'm not sure why anyone would fly to an island destination.
01879,continuation,It's especially blissful to let yourself slip under the surface and float with the waves.
01880,elaboration,Sometimes I feel like I am at peace with everything when I'm standing in the surf.
01881,joking_sarcastic,I'm just worried that I'll get so relaxed that I fall asleep and wake up in Mexico!
01882,change,I'm looking forward to when I'll have my own kids to take to the beach.
01883,continuation,"Me too, although I appreciate it in a different way now. When I was a kid it was all about trying to cram as much fun in as possible, but now I can relax and appreciate the beauty."
01884,elaboration,"Not me, I grew up in the midwest and we didn't have beaches, so this is all pretty new to me."
01885,joking_sarcastic,Was that back when you crawled out of the primordial ooze?
01886,change,We could do some wake boarding if your up to it.
01887,continuation,Don't forget the lobster and clams.
01888,elaboration,Make that Corona beer and some limes.
01889,joking_sarcastic,"But no crabs, crabs are creepy looking."
01890,change,"Have you ever tried one of those relaxation sound machines? It's probably not as nice as the real thing, but now I'm wondering if playing the sound of waves would help me fall asleep at night."
01891,continuation,"Those are nice, but I prefer the surf, I feel like there's more variety, it's always changing, but kind of always the same, too."
01892,elaboration,"I like the sound of the ocean. It sounds so big, which makes me feel like my problems are smaller by comparison."
01893,joking_sarcastic,"Uh oh, I hope this doesn't turn into a fresh water vs. salt water rap battle."
01894,change,"Speaking of relaxation, I've been thinking about taking a class on meditation."
01895,continuation,If I wasn't concerned about getting too much sun I'd like to just lie down there and let it lull me to sleep.
01896,elaboration,"Yeah. It's kind of funny though, because there's so much movement and unpredictability with the waves, you'd think that would be associated with chaos and being all jumpy, not calmness and relaxing."
01897,joking_sarcastic,Leave it to humans to go through so much trouble to get away from nature and then build electronic gizmos to replicate it.
01898,change,The sounds at the beach are great but I love the sights too.  I could stare at the water all day long.  It's mesmerizing.
01899,continuation,"All of the sounds make for the perfect beach day, I also like looking out into the water and watching the sailboats."
01900,elaboration,Do you have any beach vacations planned this year?  They are always so relaxing.
01901,joking_sarcastic,"I love the seagulls, but sometimes they will come right down and steal your lunch!"
01902,change,"I'd like to walk around here more, but there's nowhere that you can get away from the sound of traffic, so I can never fully relax."
01903,continuation,"Hehe. Some of them are nice to look at, though."
01904,elaboration,Yeah. Sometimes the biggest problem with the beach is all the other people who like the beach.
01905,joking_sarcastic,"Ah, the song of my people, I know it well."
01906,change,"I also like to check out pools in the summer, sometimes it's nice not to have to deal with the sand."
01907,continuation,I have listened to shells many times.  My Mom used to tell me the ocean was talking to me.
01908,elaboration,I also love the sound of the surf especially because it may mean that there are big waves.
01909,joking_sarcastic,How about all the sand in the car after the beach?  That's no fun at all!
01910,change,"It is, I love when the water is warm around 80 degrees."
01911,continuation,"Me, too although not when the sand is hot. That is why I walk near the water."
01912,elaboration,"I hate when the sand is in my car, it is very hard to get out."
01913,joking_sarcastic,"Yes, until you fall sound asleep and the waves crash down on you cause you did not hear them."
01914,change,What do you think of the seagulls there?
01915,continuation,I love walking on the beach too. I especially like to find shells.
01916,elaboration,I love the sand as well but not in my car. it is really hard to clean out.
01917,joking_sarcastic,The sand is awful
01918,change,What beach is your favorite?
01919,continuation,Yes definitely I always keep Purell on me.
01920,elaboration,I also love the sunset at the beach too.
01921,joking_sarcastic,"It is so great when it gets really cold at the beach, I just love it."
01922,change,"Sometime I think about maybe getting a boat, I bet that's fun, too."
01923,continuation,"Ugh, now I'm thinking about what else squishes between my toes."
01924,elaboration,"And the water can rush over your feet every now and then, that's nice, too."
01925,joking_sarcastic,I try to squish the seagulls between my toes but they're too quick for me.
01926,change,Well some travel magazines could show you a lot of places to go if you want to take a trip someday.
01927,continuation,I would say that most of it  is beautiful although there are areas that could be classified as poop.
01928,elaboration,"Look at the Grand Canyon or the desserts, the Redwood Forest of Niagara Falls, they are all majestic."
01929,joking_sarcastic,"Or Harlem, or Detroit....."
01930,change,I love owning houses with wooded backyards. Nothing feels better than to lay out under a tree and sun yourself on a warm day.
01931,continuation,It depends on the age of the tree and what kinds of permits you might have to file. My grand father built me a treehouse and each year he'd expand it as his gift to me.
01932,elaboration,I hope your kids can have the same fond memories that I did of playing in one.
01933,joking_sarcastic,My treehouse even had power and a tv!
01934,change,I love when you can see all the different fish in the ocean.
01935,continuation,Sea shells are so pretty and make a great decoration in your house.
01936,elaboration,I really enjoying when you put a sea shell to your ear and you can hear the ocean.
01937,joking_sarcastic,Especially when you collect one with a crab in it.
01938,change,"No, but have you been to aquariums? All the water with none of the wet!"
01939,continuation,I've been to a ton! My favorite was in the Wisconsin Dells.
01940,elaboration,No way! The water there is super gross and dirty.
01941,joking_sarcastic,"I tried once, but my water doesn't get along with other water, so I just walk him around the block now."
01942,change,"That's true, the home owner's association might just have a coronary if he reported it."
01943,continuation,"Yeah, but this neighbor goes in my yard all the time. I don't think he would have minded."
01944,elaboration,"Yeah, but he invites everyone to his prestigious pool parties in summer. He would have to invite me again!"
01945,joking_sarcastic,Well if I happened to nonchalantly walk by his house with a plate of cookies he might change his mind.
01946,change,I love to bounce.
01947,continuation,That sounds like a fun experiences. Jumping on trampolines is always fun.
01948,elaboration,"Yea, I had a trampoline too. It was in my backyard."
01949,joking_sarcastic,Just dont eat before you trampoline
01950,change,Swimming is fun anywhere.
01951,continuation,"Yea, skinny dipping sounds pretty relaxing in nice water."
01952,elaboration,You skinny dipped? I would never!
01953,joking_sarcastic,You can skinny dip in my pool any day.
01954,change,Yea I love just relaxing.
01955,continuation,"Yea, I just love the thrill of that."
01956,elaboration,"Yea, that feeling of the water hitting your body is amazing."
01957,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, cold water on me. Great!"
01958,change,I feel like I'm ready for a nice bath now.
01959,continuation,I have lots of favorites. The cherry ones are the best.
01960,elaboration,"Yea, I have a couple favorites, but they are expensive."
01961,joking_sarcastic,My favorite is when I bathe without weird smells.
01962,change,Have you ever tried those beach scented bath bombs? They smell exactly like coconut and sunscreen.
01963,continuation,"Yeah, and beach sand is magical. It somehow makes your skin super soft."
01964,elaboration,"I know, right? Beach baths should just be a given."
01965,joking_sarcastic,"Yes, after stressing furiously at the beach, one must relieve themselves of that stress with a nice bath."
01966,change,I think driving through the mountains would be great since I could then see the sights.
01967,continuation,I don't think hiking is for me. It's a lot of hard work really.
01968,elaboration,I like the scenery of mountains but don't think I could handle hiking physically since I had my health issues.
01969,joking_sarcastic,I'd fall down the side of one and end up having to live in a cave.
01970,change,I love wearing lots of clothes.
01971,continuation,"Yea, those are all not fun. Thats the worst part of traveling."
01972,elaboration,"Yea, somebody has to do it  though."
01973,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, you could just be dirty."
01974,change,I love reading books.
01975,continuation,"Yea, what were you thinking about."
01976,elaboration,"Sure, it sounds like you  really have a great idea of what you're doing."
01977,joking_sarcastic,"Sure, spoil it so I don't want to read it. Go ahead."
01978,change,Your work schedule still hasn't calmed down? I thought it was the slow season?
01979,continuation,"If you know in the next week, I can let you know of some good hotel deals."
01980,elaboration,In those cases I just make plans and have work bend around my needs.
01981,joking_sarcastic,"As long as it's driving, can we carpool?"
01982,change,I like to travel anywhere.
01983,continuation,Sometimes you need a vacation for your mental health.
01984,elaboration,"yea, sometimes you just need to get away."
01985,joking_sarcastic,"Sometimes, you need a vacation from a vacation though."
01986,change,I love having lots of vacation days at my job.
01987,continuation,You had to cancel the trip because you had no vacation days?
01988,elaboration,Why would you use up all your vacation days with a trip planned?
01989,joking_sarcastic,See if you can just buy more days.
01990,change,"My neighbor's kids are doing some kind of charity car wash for their school this weekend, they made me promise I'd bring mine."
01991,continuation,"Huh, I never thought of that, I guess when I think ""vacuum"" my mind just automatically goes to the thing I use to clean the house, but maybe I could give that a shot."
01992,elaboration,"No, I haven't. That car washes around here charge extra for that, and that just seems wrong to me. I'm already paying to wash the car, the other stuff should be free!"
01993,joking_sarcastic,"I'm actually thinking of going in the other direction and just letting it build up, and then when there's so much sand that there's not room for people anymore we'll know it's time to trade the car in for a new one."
01994,change,I once had dinner in cape cod.
01995,continuation,Those beaches are amazing and not usually all that crowded.
01996,elaboration,"Yea, those beaches have amazing water. They are beautiful"
01997,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, give me Florida."
01998,change,Do you do anything when you go to the lakes? Do you visit any of the tourist attractions or great shops? I'll show you some if you want.
01999,continuation,The grate lakes are awesome. They're like the ocen in the sense that there are sandy beaches and a lot of water.
02000,elaboration,I go to Lake Michigan pretty often because I have family in Ludington. You could always come with me.
02001,joking_sarcastic,Last time I went with my little niece and my sister. The child kept calling it Lake Missy-Gone.
02002,change,I just wanna live at the beach.
02003,continuation,We did a lot of talking and playing sports.
02004,elaboration,"We just enjoyed life. Ate, talked, played."
02005,joking_sarcastic,We did a lot of soul searching.
02006,change,I just love being able to go to the beach.
02007,continuation,Sometimes taking long walks is relaxing and is good for your health.
02008,elaboration,"Yea, sometimes you can find really cool things that way."
02009,joking_sarcastic,Do the rocks sound like the ocean?
02010,change,I'll find something to get the smell out. I hear vinegar mixed with peroxide is a good cleaner and deodorizer.
02011,continuation,"You have to make sure the towels are dry, though, and I'm not sure we have enough."
02012,elaboration,We use towels to dry off and need to pack extra for the ride home.
02013,joking_sarcastic,The inside of this car is going to smell like a mermaid's bedroom.
02014,change,I have to get my car fixed soon.
02015,continuation,How many repair shops are in your area?
02016,elaboration,Where's the closest repair shop?
02017,joking_sarcastic,Why don't you just google one.
02018,change,I love watching anything that plays on my TV set.
02019,continuation,Nature films can feature some really chilling things.
02020,elaboration,"Yea, its amazing what nature can do sometimes."
02021,joking_sarcastic,I prefer to just be out in nature.
02022,change,"I can never decide what to buy between a laptop, desktop, or tablet. There's just so many choices on the shelves these days that I try to stick to brands that I recognize."
02023,continuation,"The best time to shop online is black Friday. I've gotten multiple computers and devices on sale as much as 50% off, it just requires patience."
02024,elaboration,It's always nice to get a discount on purchasing a computer. If not they can be super expensive.
02025,joking_sarcastic,Not to mention that you have to change computers like underwear these days.
02026,change,"I get tempted to ask my Dad to do the negotiating for me. I'd feel like a baby not doing it myself, but he has so much more experience that I know he'd make a better deal than I would."
02027,continuation,"Yeah, they're so expensive that I get nervous that I'll make a mistake in the negotiation, which ironically makes it more likely that I'll make a mistake."
02028,elaboration,The people that sell them have so much more information that it always feels like they have the advantage.
02029,joking_sarcastic,"Yes, it's very intimidating, I think that's why muggers are switching from knives and guns to offering deals on Toyota Camrys."
02030,change,I love to buy things.
02031,continuation,"Yea, you should always do research before approaching a salesperson."
02032,elaboration,"Research is always good to do when you are buying anything, isn't it?"
02033,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, just do a research paper about it."
02034,change,I love car shopping.
02035,continuation,You really do have to try hard to find the best deal when searching for a new car.
02036,elaboration,"Yea, I like to look around a lot when I'm trying to buy a new car."
02037,joking_sarcastic,Why not just ask your friend to sell you his.
02038,change,I love purchasing cars.
02039,continuation,I think you should do lots of research before talking to a salesman.
02040,elaboration,You might wanna look up many cars before going to a dealer. I agree
02041,joking_sarcastic,"Well, you wouldn't wanna get scammed by the sales person."
02042,change,I usually spend my money wisely.
02043,continuation,"Yea, thats happened to the best of us. Sales men know how to sell."
02044,elaboration,"Yea, those sales people can be tough to get along with."
02045,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, well their job is to sell."
02046,change,I like to play on my computer.
02047,continuation,"Yea, computers can do it all these days."
02048,elaboration,It sure is amazing what computers can do!
02049,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, computers sure rule our lives, dont they?"
02050,change,"It would probably named ""Siri"" or ""Alexa"" though. I've noticed all the artificial intelligence bots are named after girls."
02051,continuation,What kind of car are you thinking about getting until Jeeves drives into your life?
02052,elaboration,"I'm not too sure it would be completely safe, though. What if the car wrecks itself and you can't stop it?"
02053,joking_sarcastic,Yeah. Your own personal designated driver for those crazy Friday nights.
02054,change,I love the open road. That's why I like to run so much. There is nothing like finishing a marathon.
02055,continuation,Sports cars are the best. I feel so free and open when I get to drive my brother's Mazda.
02056,elaboration,Or a motorcycle. That's still just you and the highway. What a feeling!
02057,joking_sarcastic,"That sounds fun. I'd just embrace the self driving revolution, personally. I like to be as lazy as possible."
02058,change,"I think you should definitely keep the one you have, and maybe get a bicycle so we can go biking."
02059,continuation,"That is a really good long term strategy, financially. You never really should have to buy a brand new one."
02060,elaboration,"I think if you make sure to change the oil frequently, it should last a good long while."
02061,joking_sarcastic,Or you could downgrade to a moped!
02062,change,Sometimes I get a little jealous of people who live in cities and can get away with not even having a car.
02063,continuation,I suppose that's better than having to deal with unexpected breakdowns.
02064,elaboration,"Yeah, I should have done a better job back when mine was new, I'm paying for that now."
02065,joking_sarcastic,"Hey, are you buying the car or is the car buying you?"
02066,change,Cars are fun to talk about aren't they.
02067,continuation,What exactly does that mean? What is she responsible for?
02068,elaboration,You're giving her a big role it seems like?
02069,joking_sarcastic,Is the car a human? It gets an education?
02070,change,I love shopping for cars.
02071,continuation,You do love shopping for boats?
02072,elaboration,What boat are you gonna buy now? A bigger one?
02073,joking_sarcastic,A bigger boat is a lighter wallet.
02074,change,I love buying things. I'm a spender.
02075,continuation,"Yea, buying stuff is always hard when you don't have tons of money."
02076,elaboration,I think buying is the best part. Its kinda like gambling.
02077,joking_sarcastic,"Well, if I could avoid buying things while still enjoying the pleasure from them, I would."
02078,change,"I wish I could just hire an agent or something who would take care of it for me, but then I'd just end up worrying that the agent was ripping me off instead of the sales people."
02079,continuation,"Yeah, and they know how tempting it is for you to just agree to the deal to get it over with."
02080,elaboration,"And since they refine their approach with every person they sell to they know what techniques work, the deck is stacked in their favor."
02081,joking_sarcastic,"The trick is to pretend you don't speak English, then they won't be so pushy about trying to sell you a car. They will try to rush you off the lot, though, so there are pros and cons."
02082,change,I just like my car that I have now.
02083,continuation,"Yea, they can confuse the heck out of you sometimes."
02084,elaboration,"Yea, some cars salesman speak a mile a minute."
02085,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, they talk faster than they think."
02086,change,"Yeah, I found it, but then my little brother took it and lost it again. He was just a little kid so it's probably not fair to blame him, but I was so mad at the time!"
02087,continuation,Yeah. I was just walking and hit something with my foot. I would have kept on going but I noticed something shiny when I looked down so I stopped and picked it up.
02088,elaboration,"Yeah, it was a 1908 double eagle. Somebody must have dropped it from a collection or something, I can't imagine how else it could have gotten there."
02089,joking_sarcastic,"Wait, wait, wait. You had shells on your beach? Now I feel like I got ripped off."
02090,change,"Yes, it's quite hard, like a needle in a haystack. But a lot of things are like that. I used to be a bird watcher, and it would take me years to find specific birds that were supposed to be at the beach."
02091,continuation,"Yes, I found it accidentally. My grandfather used metal detectors and he only found one coin on the beach in twenty years of looking."
02092,elaboration,Anything you do in nature takes a lot of dedication. I admire how hard people who treasure hunt work on finding stuff on the beach.
02093,joking_sarcastic,"You know, no one finds anything worthwhile, but it's still a better shot than the lottery, huh?"
02094,change,Oh man remember those chocolate pirate gold coins?
02095,continuation,"Yeah, just one of those 9/11 ones."
02096,elaboration,"Neither, I think some foreign traveler dropped a pound sterling."
02097,joking_sarcastic,Both! It was a pirate commemorative coin!
02098,change,I love to walk around the ocean.
02099,continuation,What kind of exercise do you do? Walk?
02100,elaboration,Exercise is always fun! I like it!
02101,joking_sarcastic,What kind of exercise is staring?
02102,change,We should go take some photos of the beach at night or in the morning. It would be pretty.
02103,continuation,Nights can be a good time too. It depends on the temp for me. I don't like to be chilly.
02104,elaboration,I also like the birds being active so I can watch them and mornings seem to be better for that.
02105,joking_sarcastic,I am not much of a morning person either so the beach gives me an incentive to keep from sleeping till noon.
02106,change,If you wanted to we could plan a vacation to the ocean this summer. We could share a cottage.
02107,continuation,I would love to wake up with the ocean nearby. I have always dreamed of that.
02108,elaboration,I considered moving near the ocean but I'm not sure I could afford to.
02109,joking_sarcastic,"I'd never leave the beach, though, so I'd get permanently coated in salt."
02110,change,I like to be clean all the time.
02111,continuation,"Yea, you are very clumsy. You've done a lot of silly stuff."
02112,elaboration,I don't think that your clumsy. You just dont pay attention.
02113,joking_sarcastic,You are one clumsy soul.
02114,change,"Yea, I wanna vacation someday. I hope!"
02115,continuation,I love those places. They all have beautiful beaches.
02116,elaboration,"Yea, those places are all majestic. They have good food too."
02117,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, the only problem is I have no money."
02118,change,"It's always about scantily clad women with you, isn't it?"
02119,continuation,That's not bad. Also don't have to worry about throwing a football into another group or having someone kick sand on you.
02120,elaboration,And no stupid planes flying buy hauling messages about where to eat and interrupting your nap.
02121,joking_sarcastic,But how are you going to look at other women in their bikinis if no one else is there?
02122,change,"The beach is a really nice place to relax, but sometimes a nice deep tissue massage is just what I need to relax and escape reality."
02123,continuation,I can relate. Even though it feels like you're alone there are millions of sea creatures in the water that you'll never see.
02124,elaboration,I think the beach can be a great place to go when you're stressed and need work. The white noise of the water is a constant background sound that makes getting work done easier.
02125,joking_sarcastic,At least until the tide comes up and you get wet!
02126,change,"I wish I was rich enough to have beachfront property, but unless I hit the lottery I don't see it happening."
02127,continuation,"Having your own beach would be awesome, you'd get all the benefits without the hassles of getting back and forth."
02128,elaboration,"That would be sweet, I always feel so hemmed in by the other people at a public beach."
02129,joking_sarcastic,"No, you've got it backwards, if you've got your own island you don't let them leave unless they can survive you hunting them for sport."
02130,change,I would but I have to be in Orlando for a business trip. That place is the worst during Christmas.
02131,continuation,I am actually going to be home this Christmas. I'd love to help out. How is old Rufus?
02132,elaboration,"Actually I'm going to see my grandma this year. I'd love to help watch your Rufus, though."
02133,joking_sarcastic,Do I get to sample your Grandma's fruitcake again?
02134,change,Don't you just love the holidays.
02135,continuation,Some nice decorations around Christmas are always fun.
02136,elaboration,I like to do decorations as well. Especially Hanukkah ones.
02137,joking_sarcastic,Just don't burn your house down.
02138,change,I like to enjoy the sun as much as i can
02139,continuation,Sometimes its nice being able to just enjoy the elements.
02140,elaboration,"Yea, sometimes snow can be extremely pretty and relaxing."
02141,joking_sarcastic,I just love falling on snow and busting my butt.
02142,change,I think I'm going to just skip that and plant flowers this year.
02143,continuation,That is epic. I'm sure they would be laughing about that for days.
02144,elaboration,"As much as I like decorations in my yard, I don't think I would go that far with it."
02145,joking_sarcastic,Are you trying to tell me something? I assure you that I am completely sane most of the time. That changes when I'm equipped with spaghettios.
02146,change,I just love being at the beach.
02147,continuation,Taking home free gifts from anywhere is always nice.
02148,elaboration,Its fun when you can collect shells from the beach.
02149,joking_sarcastic,Free gifts are the best gifts.
02150,change,Laws in natural areas vary so much from country to country. Sometimes you can't move a single thing off of the path!
02151,continuation,"Oh I love the beaches in national parks. Acadia National Park in Maine has some amazing beaches, right by the mountains. It has all the restful things in one place."
02152,elaboration,"Yes, we need rules so we don't completely destroy the lovely environment of our beaches."
02153,joking_sarcastic,"Yep, if our beaches weren't beautiful, we wouldn't have much at all."
02154,change,The cops have to do their job.
02155,continuation,"Yea, that is true. It really shouldn't be illegal."
02156,elaboration,Sometimes things that are illegal are questionable.
02157,joking_sarcastic,"Well, its still illegal, smarty!"
02158,change,"I used to want to be a lifeguard, but I discovered that I'm afraid of being responsible for someone's life."
02159,continuation,Oh good lord. That's too funny. I would've just left it there and pretended not to notice.
02160,elaboration,I'm sure those life gaurds see a lot of that.
02161,joking_sarcastic,I bet they thought you were a real criminal!
02162,change,I just like talking to people.
02163,continuation,"Yea, you just gotta imagine everyone with their pants down."
02164,elaboration,Sometimes I've tried to just practice so much that I feel comfortable.
02165,joking_sarcastic,Why not just picture everyone naked?
02166,change,"Yea, it sucks being sick."
02167,continuation,"Yea, I do not enjoy sneezing all the time."
02168,elaboration,"Yea, it really limits what they can do."
02169,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, they might as well just die I guess."
02170,change,"Yeah, I used to fiddle around with voice acting as a kid. We would record audio tapes of our voices and pretend to be doing commercials."
02171,continuation,"Oh my gosh, yes.  I used to get horrible sinus infections as a kid."
02172,elaboration,I'm terribly allergic to pollen. I get stuffed up every year.
02173,joking_sarcastic,Well you could always become the next Donald Duck actor.
02174,change,"Spraining something is a bad pain too. You know in your head it's not broken, but it still hurts horribly."
02175,continuation,Especially when it spoils such a nice trip like a beach vacation. I broke my wrist at the beach when I was ten and it was awful.
02176,elaboration,"Yes, especially if you break an arm or a leg. Somehow, that's just worse."
02177,joking_sarcastic,"It's a wonderful memory, that's why you can't forget!"
02178,change,"Speaking of holes, these moles keep digging in my backyard. It's driving me nuts."
02179,continuation,"Yeah, I don't think I would go out of my way to fill in holes. Haha, I can see you doing it though."
02180,elaboration,"Yeah, exactly. I don't think people realize that they are creating a death trap, though."
02181,joking_sarcastic,Nothing would please me more than to see you out at the crack of dawn covering holes with a kiddie shovel.
02182,change,I love comedy movies.
02183,continuation,"I just hate crying at movies too, but sometimes its hard not to."
02184,elaboration,"Yea, at least the other person sees your soft side."
02185,joking_sarcastic,Oh cry me a river.
02186,change,Definitely. Have you tried that cafe near the beach?  It's really lovely and romantic as well.  I went there on my first date with my fiancee.
02187,continuation,"I agree - I also love swimming together at the beach on a really hot day, or just laying around reading together in the sun."
02188,elaboration,"I agree, or watching the sunset over the ocean is also very romantic."
02189,joking_sarcastic,"Yep, and so is all that sand in your hair when you get home."
02190,change,Have you ever been to a picnic with any of your recent boyfriends. I know the guy you dated in college used to take you.
02191,continuation,"I like going to the beach but don't find it especially romantic. It's fun, though."
02192,elaboration,I prefer to swim and play around on the beach instead of just sitting around.
02193,joking_sarcastic,Sand in my clothes doesn't strike me as too romantic.
02194,change,"Yea, I love my wife."
02195,continuation,"Yea, I agree. We all really do!"
02196,elaboration,"Yea, most people enjoy being in romantic situations and thats why we watch."
02197,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I get in romantic situations all the time. Just saying"
02198,change,So do you like to play in sand?
02199,continuation,I always hated making a great castle only to see it ruined. I used to get pictures of them at least.
02200,elaboration,I used to incorporate shells and sea weed into my castles as decoration.
02201,joking_sarcastic,I spent more time building castles than a medieval architect.
02202,change,I was watching this documentary the other day about this festival in Iceland where they have all sorts of crazy sculptures made out of ice.
02203,continuation,They can get so intricate! I wouldn't even know how to start making something that fancy.
02204,elaboration,I remember trying to build sand castles as a kid and they just turned out as wet lumps. I don't know how they do it.
02205,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe I wouldn't have such a stickiness problem if I stuck to the non-castle sand, but I feel an obligation. SOMEBODY's got to stomp on them, right?"
02206,change,I love to run.
02207,continuation,"You can run a short distance on the beach, but still get a workout."
02208,elaboration,Sometimes its nice to run and know that you are not far away.
02209,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I love running, but not moving."
02210,change,I love watching the sunset over my house.
02211,continuation,"I have not seen a bright green flash, but I have seen pink clouds."
02212,elaboration,"I have not seen that, but I would love to."
02213,joking_sarcastic,"No, are you delusional?"
02214,change,I was cleaning out my closet the other day and found a box of old photos. There's something about physical photos that brings back memories that I think we're losing out on in this Facebook and Instagram era.
02215,continuation,"They say that all life began in the sea, I wonder if that has anything to do with why it seems so fascinating."
02216,elaboration,"Sunset at the beach is very poetic, it's the time between day and night, at the place between the land and ocean."
02217,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, and divorces happen at the drab courthouse. Although with the way some people think about it maybe they'd be better off doing it the other way around."
02218,change,I love being on the beach.
02219,continuation,"yea, that is one of the best feelings ever."
02220,elaboration,"Yea, I just love being able to sink in the dirt."
02221,joking_sarcastic,Who doesnt love sinking in the dirt?
02222,change,I just love floating around in the pool.
02223,continuation,"Yea, I can barely get out without sinking."
02224,elaboration,Sometimes you have to hold onto something to get out.
02225,joking_sarcastic,"Well, you get just spend the rest of your life in it."
02226,change,Actually I need to cancel that since I have surgery coming up. Sorry about that.
02227,continuation,We should be still going. I have to make sure that my sister takes care of the cat.
02228,elaboration,"I think so, but we need to pack raincoats this time, haha."
02229,joking_sarcastic,Why not? Girls just wanna have fun.
02230,change,I love sitting by the pool with a nice drink.
02231,continuation,"It sure is tiring to me, but its still fun."
02232,elaboration,"Yea, blowing up water toys can really be a workout."
02233,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I would rather just pay money to get a pump..."
02234,change,"If we move again we're thinking of trying to find a place with a pool in the back yard, I think the kids would enjoy that."
02235,continuation,"That's true. But I hate it when they get to that state where they're tired enough to be cranky but not tired enough to fall asleep in the car, that makes the drive miserable."
02236,elaboration,"Maybe, but it's such a production. Getting all that stuff in and out of the car gets me tired out, too!"
02237,joking_sarcastic,"It's amazing how playing at a beach can tire a kid out, but they seem to have boundless energy when it comes to asking ""can we go to the beach?"" over and over again."
02238,change,You can also try putting plastic over your seats after the beach but that's annoying to do.
02239,continuation,There is a car wash near my house where I take the car after the beach. You pay one price and can use the vacuums as much as you need to.
02240,elaboration,If you want to try it I have a free gift card you can use. I won it.
02241,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe you don't want to use it, though. Maybe the sand helps exfoliate your skin."
02242,change,I just wanna have time for sleep and food.
02243,continuation,"Yea, its tough when you're working and have a job."
02244,elaboration,"Yea, sometimes its difficult to just get out of work."
02245,joking_sarcastic,"Well, theres just as much time in the day as there used to be."
02246,change,I just love being able to relax.
02247,continuation,"Although its easy to get burned at the beach, its well worth it."
02248,elaboration,You just have to use protection and deal with the sand
02249,joking_sarcastic,"Well, there is sand and sun at the beach. Those things kinda happen."
02250,change,I love being out in the warm sun.
02251,continuation,"Yea, we used to go camping in New Jersey."
02252,elaboration,"Yea, there are lots of great beaches out there."
02253,joking_sarcastic,Who wouldn't wanna sleep on the sand?
02254,change,Its fun being able to enjoy the summer
02255,continuation,That sounds like a good summer look. You might wanna use sunscreen.
02256,elaboration,You may want to use sunscreen and different shoes.
02257,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, that sounds like the description of the clown next down."
02258,change,I love sitting in the sun.
02259,continuation,"yea, the only  good part about the cold is that you can put on a Jacket."
02260,elaboration,"Yea, I don't like the cold either. It sucks!"
02261,joking_sarcastic,The only thing worse than being cold is being hot.
02262,change,I love to travel.
02263,continuation,"Yea, it really is a beautiful place. I have been multiple times."
02264,elaboration,Have you seen lots of picture? Some of the nature there is great
02265,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I just love being bored seeing nature."
02266,change,Lets just enjoy life!`
02267,continuation,"Yea, the winters aren't really that fun."
02268,elaboration,"Sometimes the snow can be beautiful, but annoying."
02269,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I just love that snow, dont you?"
02270,change,I just love being able to enjoy time relaxing.
02271,continuation,The mountains can be very relaxing.
02272,elaboration,"Yea, I love being somewhere where few people are."
02273,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, nothing like being alone on a mountain"
02274,change,"I was reading an article that said that ""mindfulness"" meditation has a lot of benefits for your brain."
02275,continuation,"It's such as shame that it can be an ordeal getting there and back, though, that takes something away from it."
02276,elaboration,If there was a way to get the peacefulness and the serenity without the hassles that would be great. But I think whatever they'd do to make that work would mess up the good parts.
02277,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, but after being cooped up in the car with my kids getting there I NEED some mediation."
02278,change,"Well, I'm relaxed just being here."
02279,continuation,"Yea, we can get some pizza and enjoy that by the pizza."
02280,elaboration,We can also listen to the whiff of the ball from the kids going past us.
02281,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, thats really relaxing.... NOT"
02282,change,I never really watch movies.
02283,continuation,Please don't put that thought into my head.
02284,elaboration,"Yea, the shark made you think you are going to get eaten."
02285,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, you might get eaten."
02286,change,"No, but if I'm driving, I'd rather drive to the mountains."
02287,continuation,It's only a fifteen minute walk!
02288,elaboration,"Sometimes, depending on traffic and time of day."
02289,joking_sarcastic,"Nope, you can make it with a 3-wood."
02290,change,I know. Cleaning the car is almost as time consuming as shampooing the carpet.
02291,continuation,Yes. I normally just use the shop vac and clean everything at once. It saves time that way.
02292,elaboration,"Yeah sand can really damage carpet over time, too."
02293,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, car washes should have a ""beach clean"" package."
02294,change,I know! Have you been to the new water park? The wave pool is awesome.
02295,continuation,I know. The entire experience is unforgettable. Waves are the best part.
02296,elaboration,I think I prefer the beach to lakes.
02297,joking_sarcastic,"Awww, you remind me of a dolphin. Except for the intelligent part."
02298,change,What time you going?
02299,continuation,Oh it is not fun at all!
02300,elaboration,Sunburns always turn into tans though.
02301,joking_sarcastic,Oh my hope you don't get cold.
02302,change,I had the opportunity but decided to go kitesurfing instead. Have you done that?
02303,continuation,"I have, but just on a guided kayak tour."
02304,elaboration,"I haven't, but I've heard it's kind of dangerous."
02305,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, but I think HipMunk is better."
02306,change,"Rivers are so much better than lakes. I think the rushing water is better on a hot day, than stagnant water."
02307,continuation,"I've stepped on a few things that squishes before, but nothing that I could tell what it was. I'm more afraid of parasites."
02308,elaboration,You really have to wear tennis shoes of some sort to not get gashed by broken bottles at some lakes.
02309,joking_sarcastic,"Haha, I imagine you going to the lake and you see this shark fin."
02310,change,I love to jump in pools.
02311,continuation,"Yea, it is thrilling and especially fun if you're good."
02312,elaboration,"Yea, its great! I love being on the water."
02313,joking_sarcastic,Unless you get eaten by a shark. Then it sucks.
02314,change,I like to go on boats.
02315,continuation,"Yea, smooth lakes are fun."
02316,elaboration,Smooth lakes are perfect for just relaxing.
02317,joking_sarcastic,I like everything smooth. Ya know
02318,change,Its nice being able to enjoy relaxing.
02319,continuation,I love being on the lake and just relaxing.
02320,elaboration,"Yea, sometimes its nice drifting with the water."
02321,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I just love getting sea sick."
02322,change,Nothing is more beautiful than seeing the leaves change. Fall is my favorite season.
02323,continuation,Pattle boards are a lot of fun but you'd be surprised how much they cost.
02324,elaboration,I've always loved the cool mountain air. It feels cleaner than city air.
02325,joking_sarcastic,It's beautiful for a couple of months and then everything and everyone freezes. It's like walking into a freezer at the grocery store.
02326,change,We should rent jet skis for a lake instead of paddle boards.
02327,continuation,I would be down. It is a great upper body workout to go on paddle boards.
02328,elaboration,"I do not know of any that rent them out, but I am sure we can find out where online."
02329,joking_sarcastic,Yeah right I would not be able to stand on a paddle board for more than a minute.
02330,change,We should plan a canoe trip for ourselves and our kids.
02331,continuation,I have never been canoeing other than once at camp.
02332,elaboration,I did like paddling in the quiet. I'd love to go again.
02333,joking_sarcastic,My bunk mates weren't such good paddlers. They decided to swim instead and tipped their canoes so they could.
02334,change,"I like camping, but I would rather have a camper, not a tent. I like having a door to close at night."
02335,continuation,Where is your favorite place to camp?
02336,elaboration,Would you rather camp by a lake or by the ocean? I'm sure you pack differently for each one.
02337,joking_sarcastic,You love the bugs and bears too?!
02338,change,"Speaking of summer, once my kids are out of school we're thinking of taking them on an old-school road trip to see some sights."
02339,continuation,"When I was a kid, a friend of the family had a summer house up on the lake and sometimes they'd invite us up. Hanging out on their boat was always the best part."
02340,elaboration,"It's so peaceful on a boat, kind of like a separate world you can step onto for a little while."
02341,joking_sarcastic,"It's also nice for spending time with enemies, one quick push and they're over the side never to be seen again."
02342,change,I also like water slides but you obviously have to go somewhere special for those.
02343,continuation,Do you still enjoy tubing? You used to go all the time.
02344,elaboration,I remember when we went to your uncle's house and went tubing. You fell off the tube. It was hilarious.
02345,joking_sarcastic,"You only fell during tubing because you were anxious to go swimming, though, right?"
02346,change,I love boating.
02347,continuation,"Yea, well its kinda hard to go on a lake without a boat?"
02348,elaboration,Why do you go on a lake without a boat?
02349,joking_sarcastic,Lake water isn't the cleanest ya know?
02350,change,Have you been back to Lake Lattimore with your kids?
02351,continuation,I remember when he took us to Lake Lattimore. That was so much fun.
02352,elaboration,We caught tons of fish. He made us a big fish supper.
02353,joking_sarcastic,You hated fish but ate more than either of us.
02354,change,Sometimes instead of fishing I'd just go around the shore hunting for frogs with the fishing net.
02355,continuation,"Most of the time we would just fish from the shore, but it was still pretty cool."
02356,elaboration,We had a little rowboat that we would take sometimes. Honestly I had more fun rowing the boat than I did with the fishing.
02357,joking_sarcastic,Are you sure you're remembering fishing and not the intro to Gilligan's Island?
02358,change,"Yeah, did you ever want to dive into large bodies of water? I get heebie jeebies whenever I imagine falling out of a boat. High diving is just creepy."
02359,continuation,"Awww, I remember fishing as a kid."
02360,elaboration,I bet he thought you were really cute when you freaked out about the fish biting.
02361,joking_sarcastic,Imagine what would happen if you reeled in a boot.
02362,change,I love to travel anywhere that I can.
02363,continuation,"Well, you can gain a lot of weight that way."
02364,elaboration,"Yea, the food is usually really good and if you haven't tried the deserts, you should."
02365,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, why not stuff yourself to the gills."
02366,change,I just love having the time to relax.
02367,continuation,That is the nicest and most relaxing feeling.
02368,elaboration,"Yea, I love just sitting by the blue water and relaxing."
02369,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, it makes me wanna take a shower right after."
02370,change,I just love having my feet in the sand.
02371,continuation,"Yea, standing on that board is just peaceful."
02372,elaboration,"Yea, theres something about being on the board in the ocean."
02373,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, especially when I fall off every second."
02374,change,"Mexico sounds nice, but I'd rather wake up somewhere in Europe on a beach. Have you ever traveled to any European beaches?"
02375,continuation,If you wake up in Mexico you would have had to have slept for a solid 20+ hours!
02376,elaboration,"The beaches in Mexico are beautiful! Warm clear water, white sand, and great weather. I've always wanted to go to Cancun, Mexico."
02377,joking_sarcastic,Well if you wake up in Mexico at least there's plenty of new beaches to explore!
02378,change,"Yea, going to the beach is fun anytime."
02379,continuation,That will be fun. What beach will you take them to?
02380,elaboration,Thats really good! Having kids to take to the beach is fun.
02381,joking_sarcastic,You mean you actually want kids?
02382,change,Everybody has to get old someday.
02383,continuation,"Yea, sometimes you just get burned out as you get older."
02384,elaboration,"Yea, the kid in me still has a lot of energy though."
02385,joking_sarcastic,"Sucks getting old, doesn't it."
02386,change,"Well, the midwest is a  nice place still."
02387,continuation,"Yea, the midwest has mostly grass."
02388,elaboration,"Yea, you had more farms than anything then."
02389,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, did you guys ever leave the farm?"
02390,change,The beach is really a lot of fun with so many things to do or see.
02391,continuation,Don't you love it when you find some cool shell when you're walking on the beach?
02392,elaboration,"Yes, but I have to say my favorite beach day is when it is kind of foggy out and you can hear fog horns in the distance . The surf is crashing and there is barely anyone around. It is so peaceful and almost zen-like."
02393,joking_sarcastic,I bet you see a lot of hot guys on that kind of day!
02394,change,I sure like to sleep as much as I can.
02395,continuation,"Yea, I've been. They can work if you just relax and enjoy them."
02396,elaboration,"Yea, I've heard that professional athletes use stuff like that."
02397,joking_sarcastic,Just go to sleep the natural way.
02398,change,I love variety when shopping.
02399,continuation,"Yea, I think it is a fun activity."
02400,elaboration,"Yea, a little variety is always nice."
02401,joking_sarcastic,I love variety in all things.
02402,change,I prefer listening to a gentle brook to relax.
02403,continuation,"And thinking how much water there is on the horizon makes me feel small, too."
02404,elaboration,The sound makes me feel relaxed. The whoosh is very soothing.
02405,joking_sarcastic,"No this is the ocean sounding big: ""HI I'M THE OCEAN!"""
02406,change,"Ha, you know what? At work I just had to do a training on mediation. Very different."
02407,continuation,"It seems like that's the big thing right now, I see so many articles about mindfulness."
02408,elaboration,"I've always been a little skeptical of meditation, it reminds me of hokey New Age stuff."
02409,joking_sarcastic,"Here's a koan: learning involves filling your mind, but meditation involves emptying your mind, so how can you learn to meditate?"
02410,change,You know I've heard that we've maybe gone too far in terms of protecting ourselves from the sun and as a result our bodies don't get as much vitamin D as they need.
02411,continuation,I know what you mean. My skin is so sensitive to the sun that I turn into a lobster before I even realize I'm burning if I'm not careful.
02412,elaboration,Yeah. And when I'm applying sunscreen it tends to just make me more anxious because it gets me all paranoid about skin cancer.
02413,joking_sarcastic,That's why you need to get someone to bury you in the sand first. And if it's someone nice they'll even do it above the high tide line.
02414,change,I just like relaxing by anything that is calm.
02415,continuation,"Yea, well lots of movement something causes relaxation too."
02416,elaboration,"Yea, as long as the movement is relaxing, its okay."
02417,joking_sarcastic,"Well, usually the tides can be predicted, cant they?"
02418,change,"Yea, I do love my IPAD"
02419,continuation,"Yea, humans can be a scary creature."
02420,elaboration,"Yea, we do a lot of good, but sure do some bad as well."
02421,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, us humans are the worst."
02422,change,I could stare at my boyfriend all day long.
02423,continuation,"I agree. There is nothing quite like sitting in a lawn chair with your toes in the sand, staring at the water like that."
02424,elaboration,"I know! I prefer rivers to beaches, though. The water ripples so beautifully."
02425,joking_sarcastic,"Just don't fall in, haha."
02426,change,"I find beaches can be a bit crowded sometimes. I've never relaxed by a lake, have you ever done that?"
02427,continuation,I also find watching sailboats from a distance quite soothing.
02428,elaboration,"I only been on one a couple of times, but I really enjoyed being on a sailboat."
02429,joking_sarcastic,I guess the only annoying sound you can hear on the beach sometimes is all the kids screaming!
02430,change,"No, but we've got something nice planned for Christmas!"
02431,continuation,Not this year but we'll try relaxing in the mountains.
02432,elaboration,"Just had a baby, so no vacations for a while!"
02433,joking_sarcastic,I've been banned from all beaches after the Shark Fin incident.
02434,change,"Do you usually bring food with you, or do you buy stuff there?"
02435,continuation,"Yeah, they act like they own the place! Well, they are called seagulls and it is the sea, maybe they've got some sort of claim."
02436,elaboration,They're so annoying up close. That's part of why I'm usually hesitant to bring food when I go.
02437,joking_sarcastic,You should turn the tables on them and steal some of the garbage they eat.
02438,change,"I got a pedometer because I thought it would help motivate me to walk more, but mostly it's just keeping track of how few steps I've taken."
02439,continuation,Would noise-cancelling headphones work? I haven't tried them myself but I've been meaning to.
02440,elaboration,"I know what you mean, it's so hard to escape from the hustle and bustle of civilization."
02441,joking_sarcastic,I wonder what the people who invented cars would think if they knew we need them so we can get far enough away from other cars to walk in peace.
02442,change,"Well, nobody hates being at the beach."
02443,continuation,"Yea, they are really beautiful and are a joy to watch."
02444,elaboration,"Yea, they crash on the shore and are fun."
02445,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I love hearing the same noise over and over."
02446,change,I just like being outside in the warmth.
02447,continuation,"Yea, too many people are there sometimes."
02448,elaboration,"Yea, I hate a busy beach."
02449,joking_sarcastic,"Eh, the more the merrier."

02460,elaboration,I love experiencing the thrill of big waves hitting me.
02461,joking_sarcastic,I just love being tackled by waves.
02462,change,I wonder what other objects have unique sounds when held to the ear.
02463,continuation,I know you're not supposed to take shells from the beach but it's so cool to bring the sound of the ocean home with you. I had to study why it sounds that way but can't remember what I learned.
02464,elaboration,"I agree about all the sand, that's why I always have a shop vac at the ready when I get home."
02465,joking_sarcastic,If you get enough sand in your car you can let the little ones play in the floorboards!
02466,change,"I remember that one time I thought a shark touched me and it was just some seaweed, but I went running out of the water screaming anyway."
02467,continuation,Me too. But even when it's warm it cools you down on a hot day.
02468,elaboration,Every beach I go is always super cold when I first go in!
02469,joking_sarcastic,"Better than stepping into a warm spot in a pool, am I right?"

02479,continuation,That's awesome! I love it when I find a shell I can hear the ocean through.
02480,elaboration,It's like you get to take a memory of each beach home with you. That's why I love collecting seashells.
02481,joking_sarcastic,"I'm always so worried that a crab will be in a seashell I come across, and it will bite my finger off or something!"
02482,change,I like taking long rides in the car.
02483,continuation,"Yea, its a tough thing to get out of the car."

02495,continuation,I was on a boat once . The day after I got married. My one and only boat experience

02508,elaboration,"Ha ha. It would be nice to be able to get rid of them, though. They're so annoying! When I bring food I always feel like I need to watch out so they don't try to steal it."
02509,joking_sarcastic,"Well, using Mr. Miyagi's training method, I think what you need to do is start opening bottles with your feet, and then when you go for the seagulls your muscle memory will kick in."
02510,change,I love reading magazines.
02511,continuation,"Yea, they usually have good listings."

02513,joking_sarcastic,Oh yea? I thought they featured food.
02514,change,Okay let's stop talking about poop. Since we're at the beach do you wanna go get some poop-free boardwalk fries?
02515,continuation,That reminds of when I went to Ocean City. The beach was so full of tourist trash it was hard to enjoy it.

02535,continuation,"Oh, I don't know if we could do all that. Don't you think that's a bit much?"
02536,elaboration,That's so cool! You were really lucky. I never even had a tree house as a kid myself.
