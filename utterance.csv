2392,Negative,No way! Google Home is going to fail.
2393,Positiver,I sure do! It'll catch up and exceed it!
2394,Rhetorical,What can't Google do if it wants to?
2395,prompt,I really like Do you think Google Home can actually catch up to Amazon Alexa?
2396,TalkMore,"Possibly, why don't you tell me your opinion on the topic?"
2397,Negative,"I honestly don't like either, I believe they are used by the CIA."
2398,Positiver,I believe so yes competition is good for a free market.
2399,Rhetorical,Who doesn't love being spied on by robots?
2400,prompt,I really like Do you think Google Home can actually catch up to Amazon Alexa?
2401,TalkMore,"I've been thinking of buying one, they seem so cool and so useful around the house. Do you own one of these? What do you think of them?"
2402,Negative,"No, I think Amazon Alexa has already claimed that space. They have a huge head start and a popular product. More people are familiar with Amazon Alexa than Google Home."
2403,Positiver,I think it can. Google has a very good track record when it comes to their products and services.
2404,Rhetorical,If not Google than who? There are few companies that can compete with Google.
2405,prompt,"I really like I think all this buzz about ""conversational agents"" is so interesting. I wonder if systems like Siri or Alexa can really get conversational."
2406,TalkMore,Do you own one of these devices?
2407,Negative,But I really think it's all a gimmick. How conversational can a non human being be?
2408,Positiver,I've heard them in commercials and it seems quite possible.
2409,Rhetorical,Is there anyone who wants a robot as their closest adviser?
2410,prompt,"I really like I think all this buzz about ""conversational agents"" is so interesting. I wonder if systems like Siri or Alexa can really get conversational."
2411,TalkMore,"Yes, I am interested in that to.  Do you know how the advancements in this field are going?  Do you have any cool agents on your devices?"
2412,Negative,"I'm not interested in talking to computers.  I'd rather talk to a living, breathing person then spend time chatting with a robot which doesn't feel anything."
2413,Positiver,"Yes, I cannot wait for ""conversational agents"" to get more advanced.  It will be cool to be able to talk to anyone, anytime even if it isn't a real person."
2414,Rhetorical,"Yes, won't advanced conversational agents be so cool?  It will be awesome if they could respond the same as humans do."
2415,prompt,"I really like I think all this buzz about ""conversational agents"" is so interesting. I wonder if systems like Siri or Alexa can really get conversational."
2416,TalkMore,Yeah? Do you think they will?
2417,Negative,I don't think they will. Robots will always sound stiff and fake.
2418,Positiver,I think they can! They'll be like real people in no time flat.
2419,Rhetorical,How can a robot sound more conversational?
2420,prompt,"I really like When I was 10, I spent all my time outdoors playing soccer."
2421,TalkMore,How long did you play it for?
2422,Negative,"I sometimes think, though, soccer moves too slow and therefore can be pretty boring to watch."
2423,Positiver,That is very cool.
2424,Rhetorical,But have you ever seen a kid who didn't think soccer was cool?
2425,prompt,"I really like When I was 10, I spent all my time outdoors playing soccer."
2426,TalkMore,Did you play on a soccer team?  Were you really good at it?
2427,Negative,"I personally never understood why everybody made a big deal about playing soccer.  It could be because my brothers all played baseball, not soccer, so we always had baseball paraphernalia around the house."
2428,Positiver,Soccer is so much fun!  I used to play it with my brothers.  That brings back great memories for me.
2429,Rhetorical,Didn't we all play soccer all the time when we were 10?  We used to play for hours and our parents had to force us to go inside for dinner.
2430,prompt,"I really like When I was 10, I spent all my time outdoors playing soccer."
2431,TalkMore,"What position did you play? I was a midfielder most of the time, but I played goalie as well."
2432,Negative,Soccer is not a real sport. Everyone fakes injuries and nobody ever scores?
2433,Positiver,"Soccer is an amazing sport. And almost everywhere in the world, there are soccer teams. There is so much to watch and so many people to play with."
2434,Rhetorical,Why do we stop playing when we get older? I feel like I haven't taken a day and just ran outdoors since I was in high school.
2435,prompt,"I really like When I was 10, I thought I could be a professional baseball player."
2436,TalkMore,Really? What team did you want to play for?
2437,Negative,"It's a good thing you abandoned that dream. I mean, you're good, but not professional level."
2438,Positiver,That's awesome. You should still go for it!
2439,Rhetorical,What kid didn't have big dreams?
2440,prompt,"I really like When I was 10, I thought I could be a professional baseball player."
2441,TalkMore,The 7th inning stretch can sometimes be really long or go by really quickly depending on the teams.
2442,Negative,I was just a dumb 10 year old though.
2443,Positiver,I was the best player on my team at the time.
2444,Rhetorical,Why couldn't I be professional baseball player?
2445,prompt,"I really like When I was 10, I thought I could be a professional baseball player."
2446,TalkMore,What is your favorite team?  What positions did you play?
2447,Negative,I hate baseball.  It's such a boring sport to watch.
2448,Positiver,I love baseball.  It's so fun to hit the ball.
2449,Rhetorical,Who wouldn't want to grow up to be a superstar athlete?  That would be awesome!
2450,prompt,"I really like When I was 8, I thought I could be a professional ballerina."
2451,TalkMore,Oh really? Please tell me some more!
2452,Negative,Why? That i something that does not suit you well.
2453,Positiver,I bet you could have been a great one.
2454,Rhetorical,Why would you want to do that? Seems a little silly/
2455,prompt,"I really like When I was 8, I thought I could be a professional ballerina."
2456,TalkMore,Oh? What made you decide not to?
2457,Negative,"Ah, yeah, you probably were right to forget that. No offense, but ballet is just too hard for most people, you know?"
2458,Positiver,That's cool! You should keep trying to be one! I think you can do it!
2459,Rhetorical,Who hasn't dreamed of being a pro someday?
2460,prompt,"I really like When I was 8, I thought I could be a professional ballerina."
2461,TalkMore,What is your favorite ballet? Have you ever seen one in person?
2462,Negative,I don't see myself ever being tht talented.
2463,Positiver,I have always loved their grace.
2464,Rhetorical,I wonder if they enjoy what they do since it's so nice?
2465,prompt,I really like Watching the Tour De France is like watching beetles walk across the garden.
2466,TalkMore,What do you think of funny car races?
2467,Negative,"On the other hand, I feel ya. It is so monotonous watching the same motions over and over again."
2468,Positiver,It can be so rewarding though when they finally get to the finish!
2469,Rhetorical,Is there a type of racing that isn't repetitious?
2470,prompt,I really like Watching the Tour De France is like watching beetles walk across the garden.
2471,TalkMore,What do you mean? All my friends are really into Tour de France.
2472,Negative,"Yeah, ugh, who gives a shit about cyclers. It's dumb."
2473,Positiver,"Like, cool beetles. Really great beetles. Strong ass beetles, imo."
2474,Rhetorical,Are sports not your thing?
2475,prompt,I really like Watching the Tour De France is like watching beetles walk across the garden.
2476,TalkMore,Oh? What do you prefer to watch intead?
2477,Negative,The Tour De France is so boring. I can't stand it.
2478,Positiver,I love the Tour De France! It's so engaging.
2479,Rhetorical,Who doesn't like a good race?
2480,prompt,I really like Bowling must be the one of the most boring sports to watch.
2481,TalkMore,"Yeah, I agree, bowling would be boring, but what would make it more interesting?"
2482,Negative,"Yeah, it is a sport that is much funner doing than watching."
2483,Positiver,"I think any Championship game would be exciting, including bowling."
2484,Rhetorical,Do you think bowlers get tired of it too?
2485,prompt,I really like Bowling must be the one of the most boring sports to watch.
2486,TalkMore,Yeah? What sports do you actually find interesting?
2487,Negative,"I agree, bowling is so boring! It's the same thing in and out."
2488,Positiver,"I like bowling, actually. It's a sport that requires precise aiming and good dexterity."
2489,Rhetorical,Who could stand to watch a bowling game?
2490,prompt,I really like Bowling must be the one of the most boring sports to watch.
2491,TalkMore,What kinds of sports do you like to watch? What is it about bowling that you find so disinteresting?
2492,Negative,"I hate bowling. It's so boring and uninteresting, I fall asleep every time I watch it."
2493,Positiver,I love bowling! It's so much fun because it's a physical sport but it's also relaxing.
2494,Rhetorical,Does anyone actually like to watch bowling? I haven't met a single person who does.
2495,prompt,I really like I wonder if people who like to watch sports are always sportier and like to play some sport themselves.
2496,TalkMore,Good question. What do you think? Do you think they are?
2497,Negative,What does it matter?
2498,Positiver,That's a good question. I wonder that as well. I bet they are sportier.
2499,Rhetorical,"You would think they would be, right?"
2500,prompt,I really like I wonder if people who like to watch sports are always sportier and like to play some sport themselves.
2501,TalkMore,"Hm. You like sports, so are you sporty yourself?"
2502,Negative,"Nah, I think most of them are just spectators."
2503,Positiver,I think so! Sports inspires them to be sporty too!
2504,Rhetorical,What inspires people to be sporty?
2505,prompt,I really like I wonder if people who like to watch sports are always sportier and like to play some sport themselves.
2506,TalkMore,Which is your favorite sport to watch?
2507,Negative,Yeah but then again a lot probably don't because look how many out of ahpe people you know who also love sports.
2508,Positiver,It would seem that way because they usually so passionate about it.
2509,Rhetorical,Is the armchair referee eating a bowl of Doritos really gonna try out for the local baseball team?
2510,prompt,"I really like I try to get exercise every day, either go for a walk, or a bike ride or something."

2516,TalkMore,Which activity do you feel you get the most benefit from?
2517,Negative,Just make sure you don't overdo it or it won't be fun for you anymore.
2518,Positiver,That is the best thing you can do for your body.
2519,Rhetorical,I mean does anyone really want to be known as weirdo that lives in spandex?
2520,prompt,"I really like I try to get exercise every day, either go for a walk, or a bike ride or something."
2521,TalkMore,Thats great. I usually like to ride my bike near the beach. Have you gone hiking or tried yoga? Those are a lot of fun as well.
2522,Negative,I rarely exercise. I can never find the time and when I do it's just so boring. I would rather do something else.
2523,Positiver,I do too. Its a great way to clear your mind and start the day.
2524,Rhetorical,Why just sit at home? There's so many other things you can do instead.
2525,prompt,I really like Why would someone pin their whole life's dreams on getting into the Olympics? It must require an incredible kind of person and commitment.
2526,TalkMore,"i don't really think about how they got to the Olympics i just enjoy watching them compete with each other, oh by the way did your country's soccer team qualify for this Olympics?"
2527,Negative,generally i don't enjoy any forms of sport so it really sound silly how someone would devote that much of their life for some gold neck chain.
2528,Positiver,to be an Olympian is a landmark achievement for anyone who can attain it so i could understand the sacrifice that goes along with.
2529,Rhetorical,"oh really?that's like saying we pin four years of our life to study just for a paper certificate,anything in life requires some level of sacrifice you know."
2530,prompt,I really like Why would someone pin their whole life's dreams on getting into the Olympics? It must require an incredible kind of person and commitment.
2531,TalkMore,Do you think you'll ever go to the OLympics?
2532,Negative,It can be crushing though if you work that long and don't make it. What a waste of time.
2533,Positiver,It is demonstration of great passion too.
2534,Rhetorical,What athlete wouldn't want to say they made it to the Olympics?
2535,prompt,I really like Why would someone pin their whole life's dreams on getting into the Olympics? It must require an incredible kind of person and commitment.
2536,TalkMore,I would  do  everything  I  could to help my loved ones  chase a  dream  like  a gold  medal .
2537,Negative,It  is kind  of  silly to chase  a  Olympic  dream    as  few make it .
2538,Positiver,It would  take some one  with a lot  of  strength  to   pursue  that dream .
2539,Rhetorical,Would you let a loved one   chase  a impossible dream
2540,prompt,I really like My favorite thing about going to a live game is watching the families bring their kids.
2541,TalkMore,Really? That's adorable I didn't know you liked kids! Do people bring their kids to games a lot?
2542,Negative,"Kids are noisy, annoying and messy. They ruin everything."
2543,Positiver,Oh yeah it's especially cute when you can tell it's the babies first game.
2544,Rhetorical,You're kidding right?
2545,prompt,I really like My favorite thing about going to a live game is watching the families bring their kids.
2546,TalkMore,What is your favorite sport to watch live?
2547,Negative,Sometimes though I think we take sports too seriously. I feel people need to encourage their kids to study rather than compete.
2548,Positiver,I know it's so heart warming to see that!
2549,Rhetorical,Do you really think your little Johnny is going to grow up to be the next Pete Rose?
2550,prompt,I really like My favorite thing about going to a live game is watching the families bring their kids.
2551,TalkMore,Do you have any kids? Do you go to games with them often?
2552,Negative,I hate when people bring their kids to games. Kids never know how to behave.
2553,Positiver,It's really nice to see families enjoy spending time with each other. Too many kids are attached to their phones and tvs and do not spend enough time with their families.
2554,Rhetorical,Why would anyone bring little kids to a live game? It ruins the experience for everyone else.
2555,prompt,"I really like I don't mind watching a D-league team, I just like to go out to a live game, for baseball or basketball or whatever."
2556,TalkMore,"i haven't really watched a d-league team play live,maybe you should call me when next you'd love to go.OK?"
2557,Negative,"why would you waste ticket money for a d-league team,don't think its worth it."
2558,Positiver,"i have watched several d-league team play live,i enjoy watching live games even if its the reserve team playing lol"

2560,prompt,"I really like I don't mind watching a D-league team, I just like to go out to a live game, for baseball or basketball or whatever."
2561,TalkMore,What are your favorite sports to watch? Have you ever been hit by the ball?
2562,Negative,"Live sports suck. You have to sit out in the rain, heat, what have you, and if something interesting does happen it's over right away."
2563,Positiver,I love live sports. The connection to the players is so much greater!
2564,Rhetorical,Why would I pay lots of money to watch professional sports when I could watch the kid stuff for free?
2565,prompt,"I really like I don't mind watching a D-league team, I just like to go out to a live game, for baseball or basketball or whatever."
2566,TalkMore,"What do you like about live games? I've never been to one, so I don't know what to expect. What kind of games have you been to? Would I enjoy one even if I don't understand sports?"
2567,Negative,"I don't like sports, so I wouldn't want to go to any game. Sports make no sense to me and the games just drag on and on."
2568,Positiver,"Live games are so much fun to attend, whether you care about the teams or not. There's just something so exciting about being there during a live game!"
2569,Rhetorical,"What's not to live about live sports games? The energy, the excitement, not to mention the food, it's a great experience no matter who's playing!"
2570,prompt,I really like We have to drive over an hour and half to see a major league baseball game. I would just rather watch a D-league team that is close by.
2571,TalkMore,Yeah? Which D-league teams do you like?
2572,Negative,I'd much rather see a major league team. D-league teams are too low stakes.

2574,Rhetorical,Who'd want to spend an hour and a half in the car?
2575,prompt,I really like We have to drive over an hour and half to see a major league baseball game. I would just rather watch a D-league team that is close by.
2576,TalkMore,"Boy, I wish I was going with you. I'd love to check out a MLB game once in a while. Which MLB team is playing?"
2577,Negative,There's no reason to leave the house for a baseball game. Why would someone waste gas money on something they can watch on television?
2578,Positiver,It'll be good to get out and see the team in person. I bet you're going to enjoy the game.
2579,Rhetorical,Who wouldn't want to watch a D-league team? I'd be over at the stadium in a heartbeat.
2580,prompt,I really like We have to drive over an hour and half to see a major league baseball game. I would just rather watch a D-league team that is close by.
2581,TalkMore,It's been a while since I've gone to a game. Do you go often? What are your favorite teams?
2582,Negative,"I disagree, you get a much fuller experience at the major league games. It's worth it to support your favorite team and be around other fans. The D-league games don't compare."
2583,Positiver,"Absolutely, the minor league games are a lot of fun to watch. I have a much better time watching local games and avoiding all the crowds and traffic."
2584,Rhetorical,Why go through all that hassle? I wouldn't travel that far for a game either.
2585,prompt,I really like We have to drive over an hour and half to see a major league baseball game. We can't go as much as  I would like.
2586,TalkMore,When was the last time you went to a MLB game?  Who won?
2587,Negative,"Forget baseball.  Now college football, that's a sport worth driving for."
2588,Positiver,I love baseball games and the long drive is worth it!
2589,Rhetorical,"Man, who doesn't hate having to make a long drive home after a baseball game?"
2590,prompt,I really like We have to drive over an hour and half to see a major league baseball game. We can't go as much as  I would like.
2591,TalkMore,"Well, what would you like to do to pass the time on the way, anyway?"
2592,Negative,"Eugh, I know. I hate driving."
2593,Positiver,It won't be so bad! We can bond in the car!
2594,Rhetorical,Who likes long car trips?
2595,prompt,I really like We have to drive over an hour and half to see a major league baseball game. We can't go as much as  I would like.

2597,Negative,"Ugh, I hate long drives, that must have been so annoying."
2598,Positiver,"I bet the times you do go are pretty great though, it's fun."
2599,Rhetorical,"At least you get to go at all, right?"
2600,prompt,I really like We have a local D-league team. It's amazing how much it brings the whole town together. People love it.
2601,TalkMore,What sport do you play?  How are you guys doing this year?  When is your next game?  I would love to come watch.
2602,Negative,Is D-League even very competitive?  It kind of sounds like a waste of time.
2603,Positiver,I love sports teams they are a great way to meet new friends and have fun at the same time.
2604,Rhetorical,Don't you love team activities?  I sure do.
2605,prompt,I really like We have a local D-league team. It's amazing how much it brings the whole town together. People love it.
2606,TalkMore,Do you watch them play? I bet it's a lot of fun. What sport is it? Tell me about it!
2607,Negative,"I don't really care for sports, and I don't like most people anyway. They're so lame."
2608,Positiver,I bet it does! There's not much like a local team to bring a community together!
2609,Rhetorical,Why wouldn't it? There's probably not a lot else to do as a community.
2610,prompt,I really like We have a local D-league team. It's amazing how much it brings the whole town together. People love it.
2611,TalkMore,"So, what is the name of your team? I've never heard of it and it sounds interesting."
2612,Negative,"D-League teams might bring the town together, but they're always disappointing. They'll never be good enough, and trap the town in mediocrity."
2613,Positiver,I'm glad that your team brings people together.  Too many don't.
2614,Rhetorical,Am I  the only one that prefers the big leagues?
2615,prompt,I really like I was a Warriors fan when they were at the bottom of the league. That was a long time ago obviously. I am still a fan.
2616,TalkMore,What other teams do you follow?
2617,Negative,I personally think fandom has gotten out of control because some people neglect their family to stay devoted to their sport.
2618,Positiver,That is nice you were always there for them.
2619,Rhetorical,Do you really think seeing your favorite team play is more important than your daughter's birthday?
2620,prompt,I really like I was a Warriors fan when they were at the bottom of the league. That was a long time ago obviously. I am still a fan.
2621,TalkMore,What do you like most about the team. Can you give me some stats
2622,Negative,I don't like them at all. Back in my home state I rooted for only one team.
2623,Positiver,Yes I think the warriors are great aren't they . It's great after all these years you are still rooting for them.
2624,Rhetorical,I think my team in my hometown is way better. That's just my opinion.
2625,prompt,I really like I was a Warriors fan when they were at the bottom of the league. That was a long time ago obviously. I am still a fan.
2626,TalkMore,Yeah? Tell me more about the Warriors.
2627,Negative,They aren't so good anymore.
2628,Positiver,I'm a fan too! I love them.
2629,Rhetorical,How could you not be a fan?
2630,prompt,"I really like I'm interested in this change in how people watch television that comes from this new idea of a series that gets released all at once that people binge-watch, like ""Orange is the New Black"", or ""House of Cards""."
2631,TalkMore,Do you binge watch shows? What television show is your favorite to binge watch?
2632,Negative,I don't binge watch shows. It's unhealthy sitting in front of the TV all day.
2633,Positiver,It's very fascinating. Those shows are very good so I can understand why people watch them so quickly.
2634,Rhetorical,Who doesn't like to binge watch a good show? It's a great way to relax.
2635,prompt,"I really like I'm interested in this change in how people watch television that comes from this new idea of a series that gets released all at once that people binge-watch, like ""Orange is the New Black"", or ""House of Cards""."
2636,TalkMore,What is your all time favorite TV series or at least your current favorite one?
2637,Negative,The only problem is when you get to the end of the series. It's like experiencing the death of someone you love.
2638,Positiver,I think it is absolutely great. I love to binge watch.
2639,Rhetorical,Who can't say they have binged watched at one time or another?
2640,prompt,"I really like I'm interested in this change in how people watch television that comes from this new idea of a series that gets released all at once that people binge-watch, like ""Orange is the New Black"", or ""House of Cards""."

2644,Rhetorical,Who doesn't love a good media binge?
2645,prompt,"I really like I like some of the really old movies, like Hitchcock. "
2646,TalkMore,"Seriously, which is your all time favorite Hitchcock movie?"
2647,Negative,His fascination with the same kind of blond leading lady is a little creepy though.

2649,Rhetorical,"I wonder who Hitchcock cast in this film, another blond?"
2650,prompt,"I really like I like some of the really old movies, like Hitchcock. "
2651,TalkMore,Which is your favorite Hitchcock film and what draws you to them?
2652,Negative,Hitchcock is too dark for me but others are better.
2653,Positiver,I love some of them too.
2654,Rhetorical,I wonder if Hitchcock was mentally unstable?
2655,prompt,"I really like I like some of the really old movies, like Hitchcock. "
2656,TalkMore,Yes! Classic cinema.  I think about 5 of my 10 all time favorite movies are Hitchcock films.  What are your top ten movies made before 1970?
2657,Negative,"I never really got into Hitchock. I don't really like horror movies, but I guess a lot of people do"
2658,Positiver,Me too and that's pretty rare.  You have very sophisticated taste
2659,Rhetorical,Who doesn't?
2660,prompt,"I really like There's this weird genre that are romantic action movies, where the male and female lead get thrown together into some mystery or conspiracy.  Those are my favorites, like that movie ""Red"" or like some of the Jason Bourne movies."
2661,TalkMore,Do you think you could think about love while in a dangerous situation like that?
2662,Negative,They can be a bit formulaic but not everyone minds that.
2663,Positiver,The books in this genre are good too.
2664,Rhetorical,I wonder if any situation like that has ever happened in real life.
2665,prompt,"I really like There's this weird genre that are romantic action movies, where the male and female lead get thrown together into some mystery or conspiracy.  Those are my favorites, like that movie ""Red"" or like some of the Jason Bourne movies."
2666,TalkMore,Who was your favorite Red character?
2667,Negative,Red wasn't for me. It was too boring for me to get into.
2668,Positiver,Red was so great! I loved Bruce Willis's performance in it.
2669,Rhetorical,Who doesn't enjoy Red?
2670,prompt,"I really like There's this weird genre that are romantic action movies, where the male and female lead get thrown together into some mystery or conspiracy.  Those are my favorites, like that movie ""Red"" or like some of the Jason Bourne movies."
2671,TalkMore,Are there any new romantic action movies in the theaters right now that you want to see?
2672,Negative,I do like romantic action movies.  It is just so unrealistic to be in a battle and having a romantic encounter at the same time.
2673,Positiver,I love romantic action movies too.  You have some crazy conspiracy going on and all you can think about is your partner.
2674,Rhetorical,How could anybody ever like a romantic action movie?
2675,prompt,"I really like I can't watch sad movies anymore, they are just too depressing."
2676,TalkMore,"So, tell me about the most recent sad movie that you saw. I bet that the one that I was watching was even more depressing!"
2677,Negative,Sad movies really make me feel depressed; I just can't bear to watch them.
2678,Positiver,"I think that sad movies can make us appreciate our own, mundane lives a little more than we had been."
2679,Rhetorical,Don't you think that sad movies make almost everyone feel sort of blue?
2680,prompt,"I really like I can't watch sad movies anymore, they are just too depressing."
2681,TalkMore,What is the saddest movie you've ever watched?
2682,Negative,I hate sad movies. I don't want to cry when I watch a movie. I want to be entertained.
2683,Positiver,I like sad movies. Sometime you need a good cry.
2684,Rhetorical,Why would anyone put themselves through watching depressing movies?
2685,prompt,"I really like I can't watch sad movies anymore, they are just too depressing."
2686,TalkMore,You think so? What sad movie did you see recently?
2687,Negative,"Yeah, me either. I prefer laughter to crying."
2688,Positiver,"Aw, I love a good cry!"
2689,Rhetorical,Who doesn't need to cry at the movies every now and again?
2690,prompt,"I really like I used to be able to watch Quentin Tarantino movies, but now, I always have to fast-forward through some parts that are violent."
2691,TalkMore,"Yes, I wish he would cast Uma Thurman again!"
2692,Negative,"Yeah, I don't like the violence either."
2693,Positiver,Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite movies.
2694,Rhetorical,What was his last movie?
2695,prompt,"I really like I used to be able to watch Quentin Tarantino movies, but now, I always have to fast-forward through some parts that are violent."
2696,TalkMore,Oh? What was his most bloody movie?
2697,Negative,"Yeah, I can't stand it. Violence is gross."
2698,Positiver,I love the violence! The bloodshed is invigorating!
2699,Rhetorical,Who doesn't love a good bloodbath?
2700,prompt,"I really like I used to be able to watch Quentin Tarantino movies, but now, I always have to fast-forward through some parts that are violent."
2701,TalkMore,Which Tarantino movie do you find most tolerable ?
2702,Negative,"However, some of his films I find just repulsive and too foul because of all the violence they contain."
2703,Positiver,Yeah is a genius though.
2704,Rhetorical,How many times do we need to see another head decapitated?
2705,prompt,"I really like Sometimes I just want to watch something like ""Jason Bourne"" that has absolutely no dialog."
2706,TalkMore,"That's something I haven't heard of. Have you ever seen anything like that before? If so, please tell me all about it. I gotta hear this."
2707,Negative,"I don't really care for action films. It's not so bad that they're unrealistic, but the way they portray the main characters as ""invincible"" really irks me. Steven Segall was, like, unable to be hurt severely in any of his films. It's such a drag that way."
2708,Positiver,"That sounds really amazing, almost like a trendy, foreign film. Most people wouldn't think to pair action movies and silent film together. The pairing would go together like cheese and wine, I think."
2709,Rhetorical,How could you NOT want to watch an action film with no dialogue? It's something out-of-the-ordinary and would really cut through a dry day.
2710,prompt,"I really like Sometimes I just want to watch something like ""Jason Bourne"" that has absolutely no dialog."
2711,TalkMore,What did you think of the Mission Impossible series?
2712,Negative,Sometimes action movies can really be overkill though.
2713,Positiver,Yeah I know where you don't have to think.
2714,Rhetorical,How many times do I have to see a building being blown up?
2715,prompt,"I really like Sometimes I just want to watch something like ""Jason Bourne"" that has absolutely no dialog."
2716,TalkMore,Do you prefer to watch the action? How could they tell the story without dialogue? Has there ever been a movie like that?
2717,Negative,I think a movie without dialogue would be sort of pointless and hard to follow.
2718,Positiver,"I agree, the action in those films is good enough that you don't need the dialogue sometimes. It'd be an interesting film."
2719,Rhetorical,Who needs dialogue? A lot of movies could live without it.
2720,prompt,I really like My favorite male action lead is Daniel Craig.
2721,TalkMore,Who is your favorite Bond actor?
2722,Negative,Although his ears do make him sometimes a little ugly too.
2723,Positiver,Oh my gosh he is so I handsome I think.
2724,Rhetorical,Who doesn't find James Bond sexy anyway?
2725,prompt,I really like My favorite male action lead is Daniel Craig.
2726,TalkMore,What is your favorite movie he stared in?
2727,Negative,I hate Daniel Craig! He is such a scumbag.
2728,Positiver,"I love Daniel Craig, he is so dreamy."
2729,Rhetorical,Who doesn't love a man like Daniel Craig?
2730,prompt,I really like My favorite male action lead is Daniel Craig.
2731,TalkMore,"I'm not too familiar with his work, other than James Bond. What else has Daniel Craig been in?"
2732,Negative,"Daniel Craig? I mean, he's alright, but he's no Sean Connery."
2733,Positiver,"Oh yeah, I loved Daniel Craig! I thought he was great as James Bond."
2734,Rhetorical,Who wouldn't want a manly action star like him in the lead?
2735,prompt,I really like Have you every noticed how women scientists in movies always drop things and are clumsy? What's that about?
2736,TalkMore,"Please do go on with this topic, I'm super interested on your views on modern feminism"
2737,Negative,"Right, and have you noticed that men always die first in horror movies?"
2738,Positiver,I agree what is that on about? Are they trying to portray women as clumsy?
2739,Rhetorical,Who wouldn't want to smash the patriarchy?
2740,prompt,I really like Have you every noticed how women scientists in movies always drop things and are clumsy? What's that about?
2741,TalkMore,Clumsy? Now that you mention it yeah! What's the movie with the space women doing math?
2742,Negative,"I've never paid attention really, I don't like science fiction."
2743,Positiver,Yes I've noticed that! But be glad there are women scientists at all!
2744,Rhetorical,Since when do you watch sci fi?
2745,prompt,I really like Have you every noticed how women scientists in movies always drop things and are clumsy? What's that about?
2746,TalkMore,Yes I have. To which movies are you referring to.
2747,Negative,Yeah I think it's so cliche. I mean are they trying to tell us all women scientists are clumsy
2748,Positiver,I have noticed that. They are great with picking the right characters to do so
2749,Rhetorical,Ha. I'm so clumsy myself. I think I would be a great science woman in the big screen.
2750,prompt,I really like I wonder if movies like Hidden Figures really can change the cultural attitudes about women scientists.
2751,TalkMore,"Are you interested in Science, like the ladies of Hidden Figures were?"
2752,Negative,"Schools have never focused on Science for women, so I don't know if the movie will change opinions."
2753,Positiver,Hidden Figures really showed how women made a huge difference in the NASA program.
2754,Rhetorical,I wonder why the Hidden Figures Scientists didn't get much attention?
2755,prompt,I really like I wonder if movies like Hidden Figures really can change the cultural attitudes about women scientists.
2756,TalkMore,When did you see Hidden Figures?
2757,Negative,It was really sad though to see the racism that existed in the US at that time.
2758,Positiver,I think it did a great job of highlighting women's achievements.
2759,Rhetorical,Is there anything that Taraji P Henson is not just outstanding in?
2760,prompt,I really like I wonder if movies like Hidden Figures really can change the cultural attitudes about women scientists.
2761,TalkMore,"That's crazy, I've never seen Hidden figures. Can you tell me about me?"
2762,Negative,"I mean, I hope it's nice, but I can't stand Hidden Figures."
2763,Positiver,"I hope so, I loved Hidden Figures."
2764,Rhetorical,Is Hidden Figures really what's going to help women?
2765,prompt,"I really like Who do you think should be cast as the next Bond? I liked Daniel Craig, but the last one was not as good."
2766,TalkMore,"Oh I think about this all the time! There're so many different actors who could be good in the role, but I guess they should go in a different direction right? A total reboot."
2767,Negative,"Daniel Craig was a terrible Bond, he wasn't suave enough."
2768,Positiver,"I loved Daniel Craig, I really think he brought something new to the table."
2769,Rhetorical,Will there ever be a Bond as perfect as Sean Connery?
2770,prompt,"I really like Who do you think should be cast as the next Bond? I liked Daniel Craig, but the last one was not as good."
2771,TalkMore,"Got any potential picks, yourself?"
2772,Negative,"Eh, I don't like any of the Bonds. They're all too cheesy for me."
2773,Positiver,I liked Craig too! I say bring him back!
2774,Rhetorical,Who can step into the shoes of James Bond?
2775,prompt,"I really like Who do you think should be cast as the next Bond? I liked Daniel Craig, but the last one was not as good."
2776,TalkMore,I've bet you've seen all of the James Bond movies. Which one is the best in your opinion?
2777,Negative,Any white actor is as good a pick as another.
2778,Positiver,I don't know. Craig's appeal probably has run dry for the role. Maybe Tom Hardy.
2779,Rhetorical,How about a female James Bond this time around named Jamie?
2780,prompt,I really like So many people these days get their news from late night TV rather than from reading the newspaper.
2781,TalkMore,What TV shows do you watch? Do you read your hometown newspaper still?
2782,Negative,It's terrible how splintered our society is--we used to all read the same newspapers and agree on the same facts.
2783,Positiver,The quality of TV has gone up so much! Colbert lately has been off the hook.
2784,Rhetorical,Why not just watch TV and turn into a vegetable like everyone else?
2785,prompt,I really like So many people these days get their news from late night TV rather than from reading the newspaper.
2786,TalkMore,I've never even considered that. What kind of news shows are there? Are they biased at all? Do they report on everything or just certain types of news stories?
2787,Negative,Late night TV doesn't always report all the news. You'd find much more information about the world in a news paper than you would in a twenty two minute long TV show.
2788,Positiver,There are so many late night TV shows that make the news much more interesting. It's much easier to get an understanding on what's going on in the world when people put a funny spin on it.
2789,Rhetorical,Why wouldn't someone get their news from the TV instead of reading the paper? TV is much more interesting than reading a boring newspaper.
2790,prompt,I really like So many people these days get their news from late night TV rather than from reading the newspaper.
2791,TalkMore,Where do you like to get your news?
2792,Negative,But most people are way under informed because they never read.
2793,Positiver,At least it's got humor attached to it.
2794,Rhetorical,Newspaper what is that you ask?
2795,prompt,"I really like I watched that Netflix series ""Stranger Things"". Seemed like a bit of ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, all mixed up."
2796,TalkMore,Do you like old school sci fi or new stuff better?
2797,Negative,"I don't go much for sci fi though, so I probably wouldn't like it."
2798,Positiver,That sounds potentially interesting.
2799,Rhetorical,Is there anyone better than the Starship Enterprise team?
2800,prompt,"I really like I watched that Netflix series ""Stranger Things"". Seemed like a bit of ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, all mixed up."
2801,TalkMore,"I haven't seen those movies, what's Close Encounters about? Is it that alien one?"
2802,Negative,I didn't really like either of those films. ETC is just a kids movie and Close Encounters is really dull.
2803,Positiver,"I really liked those films too, so I should like Stranger Things too."
2804,Rhetorical,Who doesn't like those movies? They're classics.
2805,prompt,"I really like I watched that Netflix series ""Stranger Things"". Seemed like a bit of ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, all mixed up."
2806,TalkMore,nan
2807,Negative,That is just not my type of movie to see.
2808,Positiver,"Oh, I want to see that movie; I just loved ET."
2809,Rhetorical,We are all different and that is good.
2810,prompt,I really like So many people now have these really huge wide-screen TVs at home. I still really like going out to the movies.
2811,TalkMore,What kind of snacks do you usually get at the concession stand?
2812,Negative,"Ticket prices as the movies keep getting higher, and food there is famously expensive, I just can't justify the price to see movies in theaters."
2813,Positiver,"There's something special about going to the movies, if you actually have to go out of your way to engage with the movie it feels like a more meaningful experience."
2814,Rhetorical,Does Hollywood make good enough films to justify it?
2815,prompt,I really like So many people now have these really huge wide-screen TVs at home. I still really like going out to the movies.
2816,TalkMore,What movies have you seen in the theater lately?
2817,Negative,"Big screen televisions are a little hayseed, because everyone in trailer park has one."
2818,Positiver,Yeah but they are great when you want the surround sound experience at home.
2819,Rhetorical,Is there a hillbilly who doesn't own a huge flat screen?
2820,prompt,I really like So many people now have these really huge wide-screen TVs at home. I still really like going out to the movies.
2821,TalkMore,I prefer to watch the big action flicks. Which movies would you watch in a theater?
2822,Negative,Not me. I'd rather have a 75 inch screen tv in my house. I'd hook it up to a bunch of loud speakers and have an awesome surround sound.
2823,Positiver,I'm with you. Movies should be enjoyed in the theater on a huge screen.
2824,Rhetorical,Why would anyone go to the movies? There'd be too many people talking over the movie and spoiling the plot.
2825,prompt,I really like Eyebrows are big right now. How does that kind of thing happen?
2826,TalkMore,Yeah. Do you think you'll do anything with yours?
2827,Negative,I don't like it. Eyebrows are weird.
2828,Positiver,Because eyebrows are cute!
2829,Rhetorical,How couldn't it have happened?
2830,prompt,I really like Eyebrows are big right now. How does that kind of thing happen?
2831,TalkMore,"That's great!  I love taking care of my eyebrown, trimming them and making them look very pretty."
2832,Negative,I don't like eyebrows.  They need to be shaped often and that takes too much time.
2833,Positiver,"Everything changes in life; things will stay the same for a while, then all of a sudden, a new style, which is good."
2834,Rhetorical,"If we lost our eyebrown, we wouldn't be happy about that."
2835,prompt,I really like Eyebrows are big right now. How does that kind of thing happen?
2836,TalkMore,What would you do with your eyebrows if you could do anything?
2837,Negative,It's silly to get so hung up on them.
2838,Positiver,Eyebrows are always big aren't they? They are part of the body.
2839,Rhetorical,I wonder why people focus on them?
2840,prompt,"I really like Linen is supposed to be the fabric for summer, but it always wrinkles."
2841,TalkMore,What's your favorite Summer fabric?
2842,Negative,It can be a nightmare to take care of because you have to dry clean it.
2843,Positiver,But it is so elegant.
2844,Rhetorical,Is there anyone who wants to wear a suit that wrinkles when you smile?
2845,prompt,"I really like Linen is supposed to be the fabric for summer, but it always wrinkles."
2846,TalkMore,"I really, really love linen. All my favorite designers are absolutely OBSESSED with it."
2847,Negative,"I hate it, it sucks and it tears easy."
2848,Positiver,"I love linen, it's so breathable and dyable. My favorite material to work with."
2849,Rhetorical,Are you not a fan of wrinkles? They own.
2850,prompt,"I really like Linen is supposed to be the fabric for summer, but it always wrinkles."
2851,TalkMore,That's great. Why is it fabric for the summer? What causes the wrinkles on the fabric?
2852,Negative,"From my experience, it always wrinkles during the summer so I usually don't wear it. I think the fabric structure makes it more vulnerable for wrinkling."
2853,Positiver,Linen is great since it is a breathable fabric. Other fabric like wool holds a lot more heat compared to linen which is why it's great for the summer.
2854,Rhetorical,Why would I want to wear linen if it wrinkles? I love being cooler during the summer but I hate wrinkled clothing.
2855,prompt,"I really like I'm into recycled fashion, which is another way of saying that I shop at Good Will."
2856,TalkMore,"Oh? I've never been there, do they actually have good clothes?"
2857,Negative,"Eugh, I don't know... Used clothes can be tattered and low-quality."
2858,Positiver,That's really frugal of you. What a good way to save money!
2859,Rhetorical,Why doesn't everyone just buy used clothes?
2860,prompt,"I really like I'm into recycled fashion, which is another way of saying that I shop at Good Will."
2861,TalkMore,"I had been considering checking out stuff at Good Will myself, is it free or just low priced? How does it all work?"
2862,Negative,"Good Will? Yuck, isn't it weird wearing clothes someone else has already had on?"
2863,Positiver,"That's cool, there must be some real diamonds in all that rough, find anything good?"
2864,Rhetorical,Is that what they call it these days?
2865,prompt,"I really like I'm into recycled fashion, which is another way of saying that I shop at Good Will."
2866,TalkMore,Have you found any new stores that are selling recycled fashions? I only know about Salvation Army and the local thrift store. I would love to try my luck in a new place.
2867,Negative,"When I shop at the stores that sell recycled fashions, I feel sort of dirty. The stores always smell dusty and old."
2868,Positiver,"I really do think that recycled fashion is a way of helping ourselves, because the prices are so low, and also helping the planet."
2869,Rhetorical,Don't we all want to get a really good bargain for something that we like to wear?
2870,prompt,"I really like It's interesting when you go to a big city, and see what people are wearing."
2871,TalkMore,What city in particular is favorite to go people watch?
2872,Negative,"That is kind of creepy, you shouldn't people watch."
2873,Positiver,I too love to go to big towns and people watch.
2874,Rhetorical,Who doesn't love to stare at strangers?
2875,prompt,"I really like It's interesting when you go to a big city, and see what people are wearing."
2876,TalkMore,What is your favorite city to go to?  What is the craziest thing you ever saw someone wearing?
2877,Negative,People in big cities dress so weird I don't know why anyone would want to people watch in big cities.
2878,Positiver,I love people watching it is my favorite way to find new styles and decide what I want to buy when I go shopping.  Big cities are the best places to find new fashion.
2879,Rhetorical,Don't you love a good day of people watching?  I sure do.
2880,prompt,"I really like It's interesting when you go to a big city, and see what people are wearing."
2881,TalkMore,Really? Why do you think that is? What is your favorite look you've seen today?
2882,Negative,"I don't think its that interesting, its just a bunch of hipsters trying to outdo each other."
2883,Positiver,I completely agree! I feel like I get to see the latest fashion trends whenever I'm in the city. So many people look so unique!
2884,Rhetorical,Why would anyone want to spend so much money on clothes? I guess they have nothing better to do.
2885,prompt,"I really like If you live in a beach town, no-one ever dresses up."
2886,TalkMore,What kinds of clothes do the people wear there?
2887,Negative,It's horrible having to see people walking around wearing trashy clothing.
2888,Positiver,That would be nice.  I hate dressing up.
2889,Rhetorical,Why would you dress up?  I wouldn't want to.  It's supposed to be a carefree place!
2890,prompt,"I really like If you live in a beach town, no-one ever dresses up."
2891,TalkMore,How often do you go to the beach since it's so close?
2892,Negative,But some people take it to the extreme. I mean how about not wearing flip flops with everything?
2893,Positiver,That can be kind of liberating.
2894,Rhetorical,Is there any day that's not a shorts day?
2895,prompt,"I really like If you live in a beach town, no-one ever dresses up."
2896,TalkMore,Do you ever see people with real jobs wear suits?
2897,Negative,People need to have more respect for themselves and start dressing up.
2898,Positiver,"I love this, everybody is just casual as can be."
2899,Rhetorical,Who doesn't love just walking about in shorts?
2900,prompt,I really like It's amazing how long leggings have stayed in fashion. What's that about?
2901,TalkMore,What is your favorite thing to wear as pants?
2902,Negative,"I dislike how leggings have stayed in fashion, they are very racy."
2903,Positiver,I love how leggings have stayed in fashion they make women look very pretty.
2904,Rhetorical,Who doesn't love being comfortable? I believe leggings have stayed in fashion because they are comfortable.
2905,prompt,I really like It's amazing how long leggings have stayed in fashion. What's that about?
2906,TalkMore,I think the attraction to leggings is the function they offer to both keep you warm and have an element of modesty as well.
2907,Negative,"I hate when people wear leggings with shorts on top of them, it looks so cringe."
2908,Positiver,"It seems like the long leggings are in style, especially where the weather is colder."
2909,Rhetorical,"Maybe you could try wearing giant socks that go over your knees, wouldn't that be in style too?"
2910,prompt,I really like It's amazing how long leggings have stayed in fashion. What's that about?
2911,TalkMore,"All in all, leggings are great. If for nothing else than encouraging women to exercise and keep their legs in shape."
2912,Negative,"I don't know about these leggings in larger sizes, though. It encourages women who shouldn't be showing us their thighs to put them out there. Gross!"
2913,Positiver,"Leggings are a great way to stay warm in the winter. I love wearing them underneath things, like skirts or shorts. That way you can wear these skimpier things in cold weather and still be comfortable."
2914,Rhetorical,Don't you just love the new line of leggings by Kate Hudson? They're so colorful!
2915,prompt,I really like Have you noticed that a lot of men dye their hair?
2916,TalkMore,Does your dad dye his hair?
2917,Negative,And others shouldn't bother they have so little hair to begin with.
2918,Positiver,It does make some look younger.
2919,Rhetorical,I mean does it really matter if that half inch halo around your head is salt n pepper or just salt?
2920,prompt,I really like Have you noticed that a lot of men dye their hair?
2921,TalkMore,Yeah? What colors are they using?
2922,Negative,"Yeah, and I don't like it."
2923,Positiver,"Yeah, I think it makes them cute."
2924,Rhetorical,Why do they do that?
2925,prompt,I really like Have you noticed that a lot of men dye their hair?
2926,TalkMore,"I have noticed that, do you think it's becoming a new trend for men to dye their hair?"
2927,Negative,I prefer a natural look over fake looking dyed hair for men.
2928,Positiver,There are so many great options for men's hair dye these days.
2929,Rhetorical,Why don't men with grey hair just dye it? It looks so much better.

2942,Negative,I am not a big fan of shopping in the stores  where there is a bunch off teenage clerks.  And I don't like online sites or catalogs that don't give a different view of the item.
2943,Positiver,I love shopping online which is like a catalog.  I like not being hassled by the workers at the store and not feeling pressure to hurry up.

2946,TalkMore,I can't imagine spending that much. But I guess we all have our guilty pleasures. Haven't you ever bought something expensive for yourself?
2947,Negative,That's a ridiculous amount of money to spend. There are so many other things they could have bought with that money.
2948,Positiver,I can understand treating yourself to something expensive every once in a while. They must really love those jeans and feel great when they wear them.
2949,Rhetorical,How can people spend that much? It doesn't seem practical.
2950,prompt,I really like My friend has a pair of $400 dollar jeans. How could they possibly be worth it?

4266,TalkMore,You and me both. Do you want to read them together? Doesn't your sister have the entire set?
4267,negative,"Hell no. Harry's world is way more believable in the movies. Plus, Hermione is hotter in the movies."
4268,positive,You're absolutely right about that. The movies have nothing on the books. They completely left out entire characters in the movies!
4269,rhetorical,"Do you also hear the voices of other people in your head? You've gotta get your mind straight, seriously."

4311,TalkMore,"How many times have you watched it? Do you think I would be safe to watch it in front of my new girlfriend, or is that too risky?"
4312,negative,Don't be a pussy. People are going to laugh at and judge you if you go around saying shit like that.

4316,TalkMore,Do your kids understand the context of what's going on in the movie?

4349,rhetorical,Is there a fart joke Mike Myers hasn't explored?
4350,prompt,I loved the Austin Powers movies. They make me laugh though some of the jokes were childish.
4351,TalkMore,Losing my shit about Austin Powers. I'm a massive fan of the series.
4352,negative,I love childish humor but Austin was too much. Too many jokes one after another.

4387,negative,"I thought Ground Hog day was just like any other movie made these days, drawn out and boring."
4388,positive,"I totally agree ""Groundhog Day"" was the first of it's kind but probably not the last."
4389,rhetorical,A new time of genre?  I would have to agree.

4435,prompt,"I STILL think ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is funny."
4436,TalkMore,I agree! My favorite scene is the holy hand granade or the wizard named Tim.
4437,negative,The quality of the filming has not stood up. It's not HD and it really makes a difference.
4438,positive,"""Holy Grail"" is a classic and it's jokes are still relevant today."
4439,rhetorical,How can someone not like the Knights of Nee?
4440,prompt,"I STILL think ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is funny."
4441,TalkMore,Are you a big fan of John Cleese?
4442,negative,Some of their skits were pretty obscure due to their addictions I think.
4443,positive,Monty Python is a comedy classic.
4444,rhetorical,Is there anyone who doesn't know what the tardis is?

4449,rhetorical,Who doesn't love be propagandized?
4450,prompt,"I really enjoyed ""Hidden Figures"" even though some parts of it weren't entirely true."
4451,TalkMore,"What wasn't true about it? I'm not that familiar with the history or the people involved, where can I learn more about it?"
4452,negative,"I wasn't wild about the movie, I thought they misrepresented the history a little too much, and a few of their choices didn't help their point at all."
4453,positive,I liked it too. You have to fudge history a little to make a good movie.
4454,rhetorical,How historically accurate can a film really be? It's hard to get everything right.

4461,TalkMore,"Did you like any of the old episodes? I'm sure you have a favorite one that somehow captured your fancy. Do you like it better than any of the modern episodes, or do you think no matter how good an old episode was, it can't compare with even the worst of the new episodes?"

4463,positive,"I agree; the way they filmed those old ones made them look like soap operas and the writing of early science fiction was so formulaic that after you'd seen one episode, you'd seen them all. It makes the new versions look so much better."
4464,rhetorical,The show finally started attracting mainstream writers. I wonder when the 'purely science fiction' writers went away and the 'real' writers took over?
4465,prompt,"Sometimes Dr. Who is scary or a bit confusing, but they are all better than the very old ones. "

4470,prompt,"Sometimes Dr. Who is scary or a bit confusing, but they are all better than the very old ones. "
4471,TalkMore,"Wait, what's Dr. Who? I keep hearing about it all the time but I've never seen it. It sounds incredibly nice."
4472,negative,I couldn't stand some of the earlier writing. Just so turgid.
4473,positive,I love the innovativeness of it. It's always something new.
4474,rhetorical,Are you into all sci-fi regardless?
4475,prompt,"I just could not get into ""Lost."""
4476,TalkMore,"I'm actually thinking of calling JJ Abrams and telling him my opinion. I have his phone number, but I think I only have one shot at it. What should I say to him?"
4477,negative,"I hated Lost.  There weren't enough answers, and it was all so pretentious."

4480,prompt,"I just could not get into ""Lost."""
4481,TalkMore,Yeah? Why couldn't you?

4495,prompt,"Sometimes Star Trek is less than stellar, but I still like it overall."
4496,TalkMore,Yeah! For sure! have you seen any of the newer movies that have come out?

4499,rhetorical,"I mean, Do dead men snore?"
4500,prompt,"Sometimes Star Trek is less than stellar, but I still like it overall."
4501,TalkMore,What did you think of the last remake?

4507,negative,I think these type of movies are overrated because they are old. Don't you think that is the reason they are so popular?
4508,positive,I love movies like this. They are amazing. I wish I could see more like this in these days.
4509,rhetorical,What do you think is the better movie? Its not cliche to ask if its Gone with the Wind or Wizard of Oz at all.
4510,prompt,"""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone with the Wind"" were amazing at the time in part because of the color cinematography."
4511,TalkMore,Yeah. What else did these films revolutionize about the industry?
4512,negative,"I don't think they look very good by today's standards, of course."
4513,positive,"I agree, the color film was a game-changer at the time."
4514,rhetorical,Who wasn't blown away by these movies?
4515,prompt,"""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone with the Wind"" were amazing at the time in part because of the color cinematography."
4516,TalkMore,"What do you think made ""Gone with the Wind"" seem authentic?"
4517,negative,"I really can't stand watching ""The Wizard of Oz.""  It was good when I was a kid, but I grew out of it."
4518,positive,"I love ""The Wizard of Oz!""  There aren't many other movies that have the same longivity."
4519,rhetorical,Who can honestly say they don't know who Dorothy or the Tin Man is?  These movies are memorable for a reason!

4529,rhetorical,"How could anybody not enjoy ""The Big Bang Theory?"""

4540,prompt,"I love the shower scene in ""Elf."" They sing so well together."
4541,TalkMore,Are you sure you only like that scene for the singing? Zooey looks pretty good there and there is the implication that she's nude. Do you think it was more of a schoolboy fantasy of being in the girl's locker room that made you like it?
4542,negative,I didn't like it so much. It's too much titillation for a kid's movie. There's no reason to make kids see a girl in the shower and a boy in the girl's locker room. It puts bad thoughts in their heads.
4543,positive,"I know, that is one of the BEST shower scenes in the history of movies because it was part of the plot and it wasn't about nudity."
4544,rhetorical,It really seemed like they were a little out of synch to me. I wonder if they shot that whole scene together or if they did her singing in the shower as a separate shooting and his  singing while sitting on the sink as another shooting?
4545,prompt,"I love the shower scene in ""Elf."" They sing so well together."
4546,TalkMore,I liked it too.  Did they include that on the soundtrack?
4547,negative,I really didn't care for the movie at all.  I actually don't even remember that scene.
4548,positive,The shower scene was great.  I do love the whole movie though.
4549,rhetorical,Who doesn't love that scene?  It was one of the best in the movie!
4550,prompt,"I got scared when I saw ""Rosemary's Baby."""
4551,TalkMore,What did you find most scary about the movie?  What was your favorite scary part?
4552,negative,Really?  I didn't think it was scary at all.  I found most of it humorous and boring.
4553,positive,I agree Rosemary's baby was so creepy.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I watched it.
4554,rhetorical,Don't you get scared watching most movies?  I do.
4555,prompt,"I got scared when I saw ""Rosemary's Baby."""
4556,TalkMore,What was the scariest part of the movie for you?
4557,negative,I hated that movie.  It was really overrated.
4558,positive,"I loved ""Rosemary's Baby"".  It's a classic horror film."
4559,rhetorical,Who wasn't scared by that movie?
4560,prompt,"I got scared when I saw ""Rosemary's Baby."""
4561,TalkMore,"I haven't seen it. Without spoiling anything, can you give me a synopsis?"
4562,negative,"Meh, I wasn't scared. The effects were cheap and fake-looking."
4563,positive,I did too! It was such an effective scary movie!
4564,rhetorical,Who could've dreamed up such a frightening story?
4565,change,"I loved it, but I liked Martin Freeman more in The Hobbit!"
4566,continuation,I was really excited that Moffatt wrote so much of the fourth series.
4567,elaboration,Of course Mark Gatiss always makes everything he writes so much fun and I loved the fat suit in the last season!
4568,joking_sarcastic,"Of course, since Moffatt wrote the series, everything you love dies multiple times."
4569,change,Did you see John Krasinski in 13 hours? He got really buff. Plus that was an amazing movie.
4570,continuation,No way! Michael Scott in the American version is amazing. Steve Carrel's timing in that show is insanely good. He took dry comedy to an entirely new level.
4571,elaboration,"Plus, how can you not like the Jim and Pam romance? Jim waits on her for so long, it's practically a decade in TV years. The pacing on that show was great."
4572,joking_sarcastic,"Plus, Dwight was such a helpful guy. He was always so supportive of everyone else. It was heartwarming."
4573,change,"I don't think it was the most popular TV show in America! But anyway, let's not argue more about this, what are other sitcoms that you like?"
4574,continuation,"That's just objectively untrue! The American version is so, so funny-- honestly some of the best TV writing I've ever seen. Especially the character of Michael Scott."
4575,elaboration,"That's so ridiculous to me, it's so obviously just a cheap knockoff of the original, and no one here understands that."
4576,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, that's why it was the most popular TV show in America for a decade, uh huh."
4577,change,"Talk about stupid, how about these late night comedians whose jokes are only funny if you're a left wing fool like them?"
4578,continuation,"Maybe ""The Big Bus""...there's this scene on the bus, it's like a bar room brawl, and this guy smashes the top of a milk carton he's drinking to use as a weapon..."
4579,elaboration,I guess comedy and stupidity go together well. The Three Stooges made a career out of it.
4580,joking_sarcastic,"Do you remember Lloyd Thaxton when he took a poster of Sammy Davis, Jr. with a hole where his mouth was, and lip synced ""What Kind of Fool Am I"" through the hole?"
4581,change,"Now if you wanna watch a funny movie, watch 'The 40 Year Old Virgin'"
4582,continuation,I never really thought that movie was that funny honestly.
4583,elaboration,and they made a sequel to that movie as well.
4584,joking_sarcastic,I guess they can make a sequel to anything.
4585,change,What's the craziest thing you've seen on an airplane?
4586,continuation,"Who was it who said ""You can never underestimate the stupidity of the American public""?"
4587,elaboration,"I wonder why adults love such silly movies. Are we still kids at heart, or just immature?"
4588,joking_sarcastic,"I mean, I've seen some crazy things on planes, but nothing close to that movie."
4589,change,"What about the movies where they change everything as they go back in time to fix things? Remember ""The Butterfly Effect"" with Ashton Kutcher? I wonder how he's doing with his new family?"
4590,continuation,"Oh, that episode of Supernatural with Sam reliving Dean's death over and over?"
4591,elaboration,"Some repeat the day movies are a lot darker. I thought ""Looper"" was good, but not nearly as free or fun. Same concept of time, though."
4592,joking_sarcastic,Haven't we talked about this before? Are we repeating the same conversation over and over?
4593,change,I really love Bill Murray though. I love everything he's done in Wes Anderson's movies. He was amazing in The Royal Tenenbaums.
4594,continuation,"Do you really think that ""de ja vu"" movies are a genre? I actually can't think of any others."
4595,elaboration,"I think it's an interesting gimmick and it's a classic comedy, but I don't think it launched an entirely new genre of film."
4596,joking_sarcastic,Unless creepy marsupial like props are a film genre all on their own. I can't really think of any other films like that either.
4597,change,I mean recently! It would fit perfectly on Netflix-- have you seen the kinds of shows they're putting out lately? All so high quality. I think they've really changed the face of television.
4598,continuation,"I would love to see a show about being gay like, fifty years ago. That would be so interesting."
4599,elaboration,"True. Don't they have something like that already? I feel like they already should, right?"
4600,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, sure, we know how socially aware and accepting of that people were in the 50s!"
4601,change,It's still better than most any of the reality TV shows that are on today.
4602,continuation,I wasn't able to make it through the entire first season before I gave up on that show.
4603,elaboration,"Yes, from the weird shadow monster to why the plane crashed, it was all more over the top than necessary."
4604,joking_sarcastic,"So, basically what you're telling me is that it was so confusing drama you got ""lost""?"
4605,change,"You know, say what you will about how they revolutionized the film industry, but in both cases the books were better."
4606,continuation,"Well, in the case of ""Gone with the Wind"" it was the first major motion picture to have a swear word in it."
4607,elaboration,"The transition from black and white to color in Wizard of Oz really did draw the audience into the world of Oz. After reading the books, I think this was probably the most profound way to do that in film."
4608,joking_sarcastic,You mean other than how to stir up controversy?
4609,change,Do you remember the Carol Burnett Gone With the Wind sketch? Vicki Lawrence was pure gold in that.
4610,continuation,That's the great thing about technicolor though! It's almost like modern art on film. The vibrancy is what makes it special.
4611,elaboration,"I think realism in today's films kind of make them bland. I think that's why Avatar was so popular, because of how vibrant the characters were, from a color standpoint."
4612,joking_sarcastic,We always joke that you recognize an MGM musical more from the color than the soundtrack.
4613,change,Did you know at the time there was only two color cameras for shooting owned by the studio?
4614,continuation,"There is a reason everyone knows who Judy Garland is, that's for sure."
4615,elaboration,Isn't it crazy to think they were being filmed at the same time?
4616,joking_sarcastic,Dorothy who?
4617,change,"I'm just saying! And you're right in that it's getting way harder to find good shows, in my opinion. Seen anything lately you'd recommend?"
4618,continuation,"I mean, it's starting to feel a little dated, sure, but it's still funny. You can't argue with that."
4619,elaboration,"Honestly, I don't think it's really that funny anymore. And most people agree. The only people who watch it are people who haven't seen any new TV shows since 2005."
4620,joking_sarcastic,"Right, what a horrible character flaw that is."
4621,change,The last movie I saw was actually a comedy.
4622,continuation,"Yeah, I don't think I like scary movies. I saw ""The Ring""and it kept me up at night."
4623,elaboration,"Yeah, ""The Ring"" is pretty scary- especially the Japanese version."
4624,joking_sarcastic,Right. The Japanese are good at making scary movies.
4625,change,"People love movies with babies...Schwartzeneger, ""Look Who's Talking"", ""Boss Baby""...."
4626,continuation,Were you scared at all after you left the theater?
4627,elaboration,"When she's alone in that big house, and that scary music...my heart was pounding!"
4628,joking_sarcastic,"I was so scared, I had to get up and go to the bathroom to relieve myself."
4629,change,There are so many nostalgia properties being produced nowadays.
4630,continuation,Me too. I can't remember a time when Star Wars wasn't a part of my life.
4631,elaboration,"I like that they're trying to get back to what people loved about the originals, not do whatever George Lucas was trying to do."
4632,joking_sarcastic,Did you also have a lot of chores on your uncle's moisture farm?
4633,change,"A lot of people are grumbling about the Disney going heavily into the continuing franchise strategy, but I say if we're getting good movies out of it why complain?"
4634,continuation,The latest one is a lot darker and more serious.
4635,elaboration,"Rogue One is more like a war movie, there aren't really any comic relief characters."
4636,joking_sarcastic,"Meesa be tinkin', nosa, you  won't like it."
4637,change,I'm just so busy with work right now! Did I tell you what happened yesterday with my boss?
4638,continuation,"Definitely Breaking Bad, if that counts. What an incredible show. Have you seen it?"
4639,elaboration,"Yeah, I watched some with my sister, but I never got to the end of the third season. I liked it though, I've been meaning to get back to it."
4640,joking_sarcastic,"Right, and I'm sure you'll end up getting to that, just like you said you'd finish the Wire."
4641,change,"Don't judge my taste! Anyway, I haven't been watching much TV at all lately. I've gotten really into moves. There's this new one I think you'd love, it takes place in Maine and Matt Damon is in it."
4642,continuation,"I don't know, I think they've done a pretty good job keeping their show fresh even while using old tropes of the genre. I just find it a little confusing at times."
4643,elaboration,"To some degree, yeah, and maybe it's just a personal thing, but it's so predictable all the time and I just can't watch stuff like that."
4644,joking_sarcastic,"Right, so you can't watch How to Get Away with Murder because of this, and yet you still love Gossip Girl. That makes sense."
4645,change,What's your favorite war series?
4646,continuation,It's good but maybe not up their with MASH
4647,elaboration,"Of course, MASH was more about the Korean War"
4648,joking_sarcastic,Corporal Klinger reporting for duty!
4649,change,What about that show Chicago Fire?
4650,continuation,It seems like it's never don't moment on that show and keeps you on your heels.
4651,elaboration,There is always some type of sexual drama in that show.
4652,joking_sarcastic,Gray's Anatomy is the hospital version of Melrose's Place.
4653,change,"Yeah, it's a little unrealistic! One of my friends is a nurse, actually, and I was talking to her about it. She's so great, you would like her."
4654,continuation,"I know, honestly now that I'm seven seasons in it's starting to become hard to believe. It's just a ridiculous amount of drama."
4655,elaboration,"I mean, it is a soap opera. That's it's whole appeal."
4656,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, but my God, I did not believe so much could go on in such a small hospital."
4657,change,What about other books that were made into television shows?
4658,continuation,"I think that a book and a show are two totally different things, two widely apart mediums to convey a story."
4659,elaboration,"The possible constraints being, according to me, Production difficulties like cost factors etc., keeping the story-line in parity with the timeline, to bring a new angle of perception. To introduce new characters or to magnify the importance of some lesser known or important characters in the books."
4660,joking_sarcastic,"I think the main reason is that some of the book would be too outrageous on screen. Can you imagine seeing what you actually read in the book, you would be ready to have the show cancelled."
4661,change,"I like the swords and that archaic ambience, but not ""Monty Python & the Holy Grail""!"
4662,continuation,Who's your favorite character in the book or TV show?
4663,elaboration,Something about swordplay & that medieval atmosphere really grabs me.
4664,joking_sarcastic,I'd like to get a sword like they use...wonder if it's legal in this city.
4665,change,I need to find a copy of the first book. Which Harry Potter character is your favorite?
4666,continuation,Things are more detailed in the books than the movies. They totally cut out Neville's whole speech to Voldemort in the last book!
4667,elaboration,"Oh, I didn't know they did that. Maybe I should read the books, just to see what is similar and what is different."
4668,joking_sarcastic,"Prepare your tissues, I hear Rowling will make you cry!"
4669,change,"I feel like I ought to read more, but it just takes so much time."
4670,continuation,I heard that the first couple of movies were pretty faithful adaptations but then they started to diverge.
4671,elaboration,"From what people tell me the pacing works much better book form, too."
4672,joking_sarcastic,"Wait, so Tom Bombadil is in Harry Potter, too?"
4673,change,"Some people say the same thing about the Lord of the Rings, that the books are better."
4674,continuation,"Yeah, they're kids' movies, but there's something magical about them. Ha ha."
4675,elaboration,"There's something about the sense of wonder about the magical world, it's just so easy to get swept along with the characters."
4676,joking_sarcastic,"If you've been secretly writing fan fiction it's OK, you can tell me."
4677,change,Yes! That's hilarious. Speaking of pranks; Do you like Fred or George better?
4678,continuation,"I know, but some may be confused because there are some things better explained in detail in the books."
4679,elaboration,"That's true, but I watched the movies without the books and completely understand the story."
4680,joking_sarcastic,Wouldn't it be funny if someone left a howler note in one of the Hogwarts library books? Imagine someone opening one and getting a surprise.
4681,change,"Besides superheroes, I wonder what other kind of genres would work in the Pixar style."
4682,continuation,"Yeah, it's fun. The associations you have with the actor can really help flesh out the characters."
4683,elaboration,"Yeah, although sometimes it can get distracting, like in the Dreamworks movies where they're just trying to pack in as many celebrities as they can."
4684,joking_sarcastic,I always find stories more engaging when I'm mentally running through a list of Hollywood celebrities while I watch.
4685,change,"It's one of the most original Disney movies -- that and Lilo, I think. Did you see Lilo?"
4686,continuation,"It was such a quiet, understated movie. So much subtext."
4687,elaboration,"I just liked the way it communicated with both parents and children, like, with subtextual readings."
4688,joking_sarcastic,Really? I'm on 200 and it's pretty great.
4689,change,You probably ought to stick with romantic comedies until you get to know her tastes a bit better.
4690,continuation,"I've lost count. It seems like every Christmas. I think it'll be fine, and if she tears up that's something you can share."
4691,elaboration,It's not risky to show your girlfriend you have an emotional side!
4692,joking_sarcastic,"Only if your girlfriend comes from a really wealthy family, then she might be rooting for Mr. Potter."
4693,change,I like a lot of old Jimmy Stewart movies. Have you seen Rope?
4694,continuation,"Yeah, it really takes you to low lows, but then when everybody comes together at the end it really gets you."
4695,elaboration,"That's part of what makes it work, you see Jimmy Stewart feeling like he has to take so many responsibilities onto himself, he feels like he has to the man for everybody else."
4696,joking_sarcastic,Not Mr. Potter!
4697,change,That and Citizen Kane are the only movies of that era I can still watch. Have you seen Citizen?
4698,continuation,It's good tears. I love a good cry every now and again. It clears you up.
4699,elaboration,It's such a surprisingly human movie even if it is manipulating me.
4700,joking_sarcastic,"Movies are pretty emotionally abusive, let's be honest."
4701,change,"I wish there were more dramatic movies I could watch with my kids, but I'm not comfortable exposing them to a lot of sex or violence."
4702,continuation,"I guess that's true, to understand that it's OK to feel how they feel, and not bottle everything up."
4703,elaboration,"Yeah, that makes sense, it's easy to think that everything for kids should be fun and happy, but I guess they also need to learn that there's other parts of being a grown up."
4704,joking_sarcastic,"Plus, if they're watching the movie along with me, they can learn about how adults sometimes need to go on angry, drunken tirades. It's educational, really."
4705,change,I don't know why they can't make the Thor movies as good as Iron Man.
4706,continuation,The movie was really well cast. It's a rare case where Hollywood glamour makes a lot of sense for the characters.
4707,elaboration,"Robert Downey Jr. just has so much charisma, you like him even when he's being a jerk."
4708,joking_sarcastic,"Tell me about it, that Jon Favreu is HOT."
4709,change,Do you go to the movies with your boyfriend a lot?
4710,continuation,"Oh, cool, the experience of seeing it with a crowd always heightens the experience."
4711,elaboration,"I'm jealous, I didn't discover it until it came out on video."
4712,joking_sarcastic,"I saw it with my boyfriend, too, by which I mean I spent a lot of time fantasizing about Robert Downey Jr."
4713,change,"I know, but there are some things that could have been portrayed better. What other Marvel Movies are you looking forward to coming out?"
4714,continuation,I thought it was brilliant! Robert Downey Jr. was hilarious and portrayed Tony Stark very well!
4715,elaboration,"He was pretty good, but I found some things that doesn't really go along with the comics."
4716,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, It's a SHAME they didn't do everything VERBATIM from the comics! Don't you know that the movies would be like 10 hours long if they did that?"
4717,change,"Spoofing the spy genre is a lot of fun. The took the telephone ring from Our Man Flynt, which was from way back in the 60s itself."
4718,continuation,One MILLION dollars.
4719,elaboration,"The main characters were fun, but I especially liked the way they use side characters for jokes. ""I'm very badly burned."""
4720,joking_sarcastic,I can't believe they went in such a different direction with the Daniel Craig reboot.
4721,change,What do you think is the best movie Dan Ackroyd has done?
4722,continuation,Do you think it was as good as the original?
4723,elaboration,"I mean, it's like, here we go again, same old same old, it just didn't seem as fun as the original."
4724,joking_sarcastic,"Well yes, it did...and of course you loved ""Titanic"", right?"
4725,change,"Maybe...did you see the satire of the Beatles called ""The Rutles""?"
4726,continuation,When John Cleese fell in the latrine I fell on the floor laughing.
4727,elaboration,I've never heard as much laughter in a movie theater as I did for that picture.
4728,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe that's why I like it, I only moved out last month."
4729,change,Do you like movies about Knights of Olde that aren't comedies?
4730,continuation,What's your favorite scene in the movie?
4731,elaboration,"When Eric Idle was stabbed in the butt, I loved it!"
4732,joking_sarcastic,"Funnier than ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure""??"
4733,change,"""The Life of Brian"" isn't quite as funny though, don't you think?"
4734,continuation,The wizard named Tim makes me laugh every time. Without fail.
4735,elaboration,Why those scenes in particular?
4736,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, yeah. The holy hand grenade is just hilarious. Ugh. So boring..."
4737,change,"Actually, I prefer movies that are more true to live."
4738,continuation,"Oh, I just loved the old episodes and I watch them often."
4739,elaboration,"Dr. Who is quite scary, but funny at the same time."
4740,joking_sarcastic,"Some of the episodes make me just love Dr. Who - like, he is actually a very nice guy..."
4741,change,What about Game of Thrones? That's about sex AND story.
4742,continuation,"The new Dr. Who isn't all about sex, it's about fun and adventure, too."
4743,elaboration,"But sex is part of the human condition, it's realistic for characters to be interested in it rather than being cardboard cutouts."
4744,joking_sarcastic,Are you sure you were watching the BBC version and not a porn parody?
4745,change,That would be hilarious to see! I want to re-watch them all now. What other sci-fi TV shows do you enjoy?
4746,continuation,"But, there are some good things about the older episodes. I really enjoyed the 4th doctor."
4747,elaboration,"Yes, I liked Tom Baker as well. He was hilarious."
4748,joking_sarcastic,"I wonder if the 4th doctor ever got his scarf stuck in things, like when 11th got his tie stuck in a car door!"
4749,change,"I mean, what can you expect? Anyway, I have been planning to go see the new movie, I just can't seem to find anyone to go with me this weekend. Josh is sick again, and Marcy is busy, as always."
4750,continuation,"The movies are better than I thought they would be, but I still think Star Trek: Next Generation was the best version of the show."
4751,elaboration,"Oh, absolutely not. I don't mind either, but the original is by far the best-- how could you say anything else?"
4752,joking_sarcastic,"You're right, maybe I didn't consider the appeal of 60s special effects enough."
4753,change,"It's good overall, I mean. This isn't Battlestar Galactica we're talking here."
4754,continuation,It sucked sometimes! I've got to be honest. Gene Roddenberry is a angel but he's no Christ.
4755,elaboration,"Even the movies? Yeah, the J.J. Abrams one? I thought so."
4756,joking_sarcastic,I love watching the stellar episodes like when Kirk goes to a forlorn and isolated planet separated from all rational civilization to fight a man in a suit.
4757,change,"I'm not sure about the rest of the movie though. You saw it, right? It wasn't too great."
4758,continuation,"I liked the way the camera gave her a sort of subtle grace and didn't try to go for titillation. She was vaguely, like, ethereal."
4759,elaboration,"It revolved around such a subtle sea change in the relationship that seeing it felt honestly heart-raising. I mean, it was cute."
4760,joking_sarcastic,Generally any scene with naked people in the shower together owns.
4761,change,"Did you know Cumberbatch was in the Hobbit too? He's just in an animated role, so his voice is different. I think it's the first time I've seen him in animated role."
4762,continuation,"Yes, he is such a great actor it's nice to see him in a non-sidekick role. As Bilbo, he is so humble but strong."
4763,elaboration,He is a great actor overall. I liked him in Sherlock and the Hobbit. He's sarcastic and witty in different ways in each film he does.
4764,joking_sarcastic,"Martin is hilarious, even in the British version of the office, which is saying something."
4765,change,"I like Robert Downey Jr, and he's awesome in Iron Man, you seen that?"
4766,continuation,"yea, it's an awesome movie. I really am looking forward to another one."
4767,elaboration,"Robert Downey Jr, is the best Sherlock, hands down."
4768,joking_sarcastic,Eventhough Watson could been alot better if I was playing the role.
4769,change,Do you like that old show Dinosaurs? That one is way better.
4770,continuation,"Look, I just don't like the American version. It does not have good humor and that Jim guy looks at the camera too much."
4771,elaboration,Jim is not a good character. He takes up a lot of the show and he is a bad actor.
4772,joking_sarcastic,I'd get more humor out of working at a real office.
4773,change,"I like the slow pacing of sitcoms sometimes, you know? When they take their time with a will they or wont they relationship? The kind that keep me wondering for more than two episodes."
4774,continuation,"The two really have similar, but different types of comedy. The  american version really played up the comedic romance, while the UK was more the dull, but funny, dry British humor. I like the differences is, and the fact they both had a variety of real life comedy."
4775,elaboration,"I think it was great how they turned the everyday in to wacky, but somehow still made it believable. I could relate to the lives of both the sets of characters. The boring to the extraordinary, really similar to real life. But far enough out there to be entertainment. The characters really develop well, but not so much it is not believable."
4776,joking_sarcastic,I too have SO many work pals that have huge beet farms.
4777,change,"I really haven't seen the Office but I know it's really good, it's been recommended to me by a lot of people. I have to watch that and a lot of other shows soon!"
4778,continuation,"Yeah, he was a nice guy, but I do still prefer the UK version."
4779,elaboration,"Yeah, he was a really nice guy, he was probably my favorite character in the whole series."
4780,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, it was so supportive how he stabbed that woman in the chest at the coffee machine."
4781,change,"Steve Carrell is a comic genius for sure.  Did you see him in the ""Big Short"".  I thought that movie was great because it made understanding the financial crisis seem simple while still managing to be funny.  No small feat."
4782,continuation,Well there is no denying that the Michael Scott character was hilarious.  He was probably the best part of the show. I love the line where he says he not superstitious just a little stitious.
4783,elaboration,"Michael Scott was great, but do you remember the last season?  It just wasn't the same with Andy Bernard as the boss.  I think they should have ended the show when Michael Scott left.  Then at least they would have went out on a high note."
4784,joking_sarcastic,"""Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy, both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me."""
4785,change,I think if time travel was ever a real thing I wouldn't want to go back because I'd be afraid to make things worse than they already are right now by changing the outcome of things.
4786,continuation,There actually is a sequel to the butterfly effect.
4787,elaboration,"Ashton Kutcher seems to be doing well, he seems happy, but it's really hard to say because we'll never know how he really feels in his personal life."
4788,joking_sarcastic,"Do you mean Ashton Kutcher, or his character? His character isn't real! He's not doing anything!"
4789,change,"I agree ""Groundhog Day"" was definitely better.  I love almost anything with Bill Murray though. I think Lost in Translation is my favorite.  How about you?"
4790,continuation,"Have you seen ""Repeater""?  It is another darker one kind of like ""Looper.""  It's about a group of prisoners that repeat the same day over and over."
4791,elaboration,"Yeah ""Looper"" was decent.  I do prefer the more fun movies in the genre though.  I love how despite being funny, ""Groundhog Day"" still had a lot of depth and character development."
4792,joking_sarcastic,You mean you didn't find the assassin plot to be light and fun?
4793,change,Answer my question. What would be a good idea for a show that would get people moving in a more socially conscious direction?
4794,continuation,"I agree, I think that cable and traditional television are on their way out."
4795,elaboration,"Right! Orange is the New Black, Stranger Things, Fuller House,... all wonderful shows that are, in my opinion, better than anything on TV right now."
4796,joking_sarcastic,"The ""face"" of television... get it? Because TV shows are an arrangement of faces? Haha!"
4797,change,"I get lost on all shows like that -- Survivor, for example."
4798,continuation,"Haha, yes exactly! I had to focus too much."
4799,elaboration,"I really did, at least in my mind! Watching all these people on an island with all these different relationships to each other just got to be too much to deal with."
4800,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, I ""lost"" watching Lost because I got lost!"
4801,change,"Talking about fast paced movies, I can't stand the animated movies that come out today. Call me slow but there's no way that I can keep track of all the stuff that's happening on screen."
4802,continuation,I am in total agreement there. In most cases the movies pale in comparison to the books.
4803,elaboration,Remember when Harry Potter came out on film? I never liked the films near as much as I did the books. How can you fit a hole long book into an hour and a half?
4804,joking_sarcastic,It's like watching reality in fast forward what with all of the action scenes so close together.
4805,change,"I think it's amazing how memorable any transition is with technology, it's like we'll always remember the very first smart phone, the first laptop, tablet, 3D movie... The Wizard of Oz was the first of it's kind just like those, which is what made it so amazing."
4806,continuation,"I agree, I loved seeing her step from her house into the colorful world... it was mesmerizing."
4807,elaboration,"Yeah, there was something so amazing about the witches and all of the different colors and the ruby slippers."
4808,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah it's just so ""profound"" how sexist and degrading that movie is."
4809,change,I know.  Did you catch  Jim Parson's in the Muppet Movie or hear that they're going to create a Big Bang spin-off series?
4810,continuation,You're right.  It still makes me laugh whenever I tune in.
4811,elaboration,"I mean, even though it's and old and predictable bit, Sheldon saying, ""Penny, Penny, Penny"" when he's knocking on the door makes me smile."
4812,joking_sarcastic,"I mean, come on I still make my husband sing ""Soft Kitty, Warm Kitty"" to me whenever I'm sick.  I think it was in our wedding vows!"
4813,change,"So, you don't like scary movies very much? You told me you never tried frozen yogurt before. In the mall, just past the movie theater there is a place that has really good frozen yogurt options. How would you like to go by there for awhile and decide on something else to see?"
4814,continuation,"""The Ring"" was a pretty good movie as well! I mean, can you imagine literally watching some girl crawl right out of a TV in front of you? It was definitely some scary moments but I enjoyed it."
4815,elaboration,"Scary movies seem to be getting more popular these days and ""The Ring"" definitely helped. I think they are kinda changing a bit these days though. Not as much jumping out of your chair but more intelligent and more thought out."
4816,joking_sarcastic,"Listen, the best thing to think about when watching a scary movie is to try not to be that person that seems to always slip and fall when they are being chased by someone or something that will kill them!"
4817,change,"Hollywood seems like it's getting all hung up on relaunches and reimaginings and soft reboots, but I think sequels are just fine, as long as they do them right."
4818,continuation,"I don't know exactly why, but just seeing the old ship designs up on the big screen gets me a little choked up. It's like seeing old friends."
4819,elaboration,"I agree. And it's not just nostalgia, it's realizing that there was something beyond just summer spectacle in the original trilogy, something about the storytelling that's bigger than that."
4820,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, it probably wasn't The Force but it seems like George Lucas got sucked into the dark side of something."
4821,change,"Yeah, but I can understand it just because there hasn't been tons of new material lately; beyond disney, everywhere is just doing remakes and sequels which is getting pretty boring."
4822,continuation,"I completely agree! As long as it's something we enjoy, there's no reason not to."
4823,elaboration,"I do agree, but I'm wondering if it's going to make a good thing bad. Sometimes I think some series should just quit while they're ahead!"
4824,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, I love the fact that all the movies are the exact same crap we've seen over and over again."
4825,change,"That's too bad, I really like sidekick type characters that kind of let you take a deep breath and relax once in a while. I'm not sure I'll like a movie without that."
4826,continuation,"Oh darn, I really liked Jar Jar Binks in the older movies."
4827,elaboration,Why do you think they didn't add any fun characters like that? Didn't most people like Jar Jar?
4828,joking_sarcastic,Yeah because movies without any fun in them are just so riveting.
4829,change,"Speaking of maturity, how are your kids doing now, you haven't mentioned them in a while?"
4830,continuation,"No, tell me, but I think the best one is "" Catch me if you can"", it has elements of crime and love, and I totally want the leads red hair!"
4831,elaboration,I think the fact that she loves him no matter what and still believes in him is like the classic love story we all want.
4832,joking_sarcastic,"But yet isn't the fairy tale romance what we all want, we should probably know better at this level of maturity!!"
4833,change,"No I haven't, but I do like The Big Bang Theory. Do you like TV sitcoms?"
4834,continuation,"Yes, I binged watched the whole series over the course of a holiday weekend."
4835,elaboration,"I really enjoyed the acting, but the dialogue was what really impressed me. The writers did an excellent job."
4836,joking_sarcastic,"Yes, because you can REALLY see the dad from Malcolm in the Middle becoming a successful drug lord, that's SOOO believable."
4837,change,"Speaking of which, we really need to find a Matt Damon for Casey's, inner Ben Affleck.  He needs an acting buddy."
4838,continuation,"Are you referring to Machester By The Sea?  Because, if you're referring to the Great Wall movie, were done here."
4839,elaboration,"I liked Manchester by the Sea because it explored the idea of a young guy from the wrong side of the tracks, who'd had a rough time in life, coming alongside a wise adult to help him succeed."
4840,joking_sarcastic,"You know, like with Good Will Hunting but with different actors...oh, nope, same actors."
4841,change,"I think there are a lot of shows that do that nowadays, and they never last or seem to work out. Like Downton Alley got cancelled so soon."
4842,continuation,Why do you think it's confusing? Is it because of the detective work?
4843,elaboration,"I disagree, I don't think it's very fresh at all, the dated stuff just makes it so unrealistic to me."
4844,joking_sarcastic,"They've done such a ""good job"" that you're confused about it. Makes sense!"
4845,change,"It is a shame , the diseases in the world."
4846,continuation,I cannot believe that could actually happen.
4847,elaboration,So when the man entered the emergency room was he dead?
4848,joking_sarcastic,Well people are dying to get in there
4849,change,"Come to think of it, there is a series like that one: Scrubs."
4850,continuation,But what would we do without a series about the medical field? I don't think there is another one like it.
4851,elaboration,"I agree with that sentiment, completely. It's so addicting, but you kind of almost know what is going to happen now. Usually it is the worst possible outcome that will create the most drama."
4852,joking_sarcastic,I do believe the people in that hospital are cursed.
4853,change,True.  Like how there was this outrage over the way Peter Jackson did Lord of the Rings. They guy did the best he could given the circumstances. You can't really account for everyone's individual interpretation of a book.
4854,continuation,True. I never could get into the books. It was like swimming through a pool of peanut butter.
4855,elaboration,That series was the first of its kind. There was everything that you find on HBO plus an actual plot.
4856,joking_sarcastic,I don't think killing multiple people and being generally corrupt and conniving is a good way to play a game though. Aren't games supposed to be entertaining and fun?
4857,change,"For me it's the human drama that gets me, loyalty and betrayal, love and revenge, ambition and power, all that stuff."
4858,continuation,"Yeah, but they do it in a way that seems so real and grounded, not like some prim and proper fairy tale."
4859,elaboration,Me too. And by putting it in that kind of setting both the violence and the political maneuvering seem realistic and believable.
4860,joking_sarcastic,Although that's probably partly because we can't smell what it would be like to actually live there.
4861,change,"Did you read the side-along book ""Magical Creatures"" before you saw Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?"
4862,continuation,I don't think they cut it out so much as boiled it down to some necessary truths.  The showed us instead of told us.
4863,elaboration,"That's the trick with movie making- you have to show, not tell, to being the audience into the movie."
4864,joking_sarcastic,"Besides, if they'd allowed Neville his monologue, Voldemort would've Avadra Cadavred him faster than he could pull the Sword from the hat.  You know Volde's hand was twitching more than Christian Grey's palm."
4865,change,Do you know anyone who has been to Harry Potter World at Universal?  My parents went a couple of years ago and really enjoyed.  It's on my bucket list.
4866,continuation,I agree.  I hated how the movies left out parts of Voldemart's backstory like his mother's love potion and his Muggle father.
4867,elaboration,"Overall I liked the books better, but I do think that the movies did some things better than the books .  For example, I think the scene where Harry fights the Hungarian Horntail is much better in the movie than in the book."
4868,joking_sarcastic,I'm sure if we had directed the movies they would have been so much better!  Ha!
4869,change,I'm trying to think if I have ever preferred a movie to the book.  It definitely hard once you are already attached to one version of the story.  The Shining.  That is one movie that I can definitely say I preferred to the book.
4870,continuation,Oh I couldn't agree more.  The books were definitely better.  For one thing the movies were far too long.
4871,elaboration,"There were definitely changes made that I didn't like.  For example, I was really disappointed in how the film seemed to diminish the character of Gandalf.  In the books he was this other worldly spirit that was there to help guide the other characters.  He was commanding and authoratative.  In the movies, he was a much weaker character and even seem confused sometimes."
4872,joking_sarcastic,What?!  You mean the books written by the father of modern fantasy literature  are better than the movies?  Who would have thought?
4873,change,"Yeah, well, it's an excuse to get away. We haven't had a vacation in a while."
4874,continuation,"Yes, and I really like that it's something my kids and I can enjoy together. It's great for all ages."
4875,elaboration,My 8 year old is obsessed! We're going to Universal next year to see all the Harry Potter stuff.
4876,joking_sarcastic,"Wow, you really go all out."
4877,change,"Yeah but it's fun, I find it comforting like when Mila Kunis was the voice of a certain cartoon character I really wanted to watch it more and would even end up falling asleep to it because it was so comforting."
4878,continuation,Definitely. I get really distracted trying to place where I know voices from.
4879,elaboration,Right! I spent the entirety of the first Ice Age movie wondering where it is I knew the mammoth's voice from and completely missed the movie.
4880,joking_sarcastic,Yeah because money is *the* most important thing in the whole world so if they can squeeze in as many big names as possible who cares if it's a crappy movie! People will watch it anyway.
4881,change,That's why I like family guy. Trying to pick out all of the guest appearances makes it more rich and intertaining.
4882,continuation,"That's why I take the time to read the credits. Most people want to skip past them, but not me."
4883,elaboration,It's quite a fun challenge to pick out celebrity voices from animated movies and shows.
4884,joking_sarcastic,Isn't it funny when dignified individuals are paid to be in these crazy roles in comedy animation?
4885,change,What if the villain ended up winning the battle. What would happen then?
4886,continuation,I liked the way it brought back some of the comic book theme from years ago along with present day themes that were entertaining.
4887,elaboration,Having children with super powers also adds to the excitement especially for the kids.
4888,joking_sarcastic,The villain always has a plot to take over the world and gets foiled in the end by the good guys.
4889,change,What's wrong with sad movies or scary ones? What ever happened to cuddling to a horror movie?
4890,continuation,"Alright, but how am I supposed to get to know her tastes if that's all we watch?"
4891,elaboration,What kinds of romantic comedies? I haven't seen many of those and I'm not sure which ones she'd like or appreciate watching. What if she's not into those either?
4892,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, because romantic comedies are great, deep movies that will just be so interesting to her..."
4893,change,What do you usually do on a first date?
4894,continuation,"Yeah, I just don't want to look silly if she's not emotional about it."
4895,elaboration,I understand. Sometimes that's a big turn off in a new relationship.
4896,joking_sarcastic,Gotta save that stuff for when you're old and married.
4897,change,"Around Christmas I like to balance it out with The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, where you can root for the bad guy for bit."
4898,continuation,"It's like a roller coaster, you know the ups and downs are coming, but it still takes you for a ride."
4899,elaboration,"It's a little hokey at the end, but they make you care so much about these people that you're willing to accept it because that's the way things ought to work."
4900,joking_sarcastic,"The should probably fire Uncle Billy from the Building and Loan, though, he's kind of terrible at taking care of money."
4901,change,"You really do see him doing so much for his family in that movie. Gift of The Magi is another Christmas movie I enjoy, where the main characters try really hard to provide for each other but can't seem to."
4902,continuation,Exactly. He is such a relatable character in so many ways. Anyone with kids or a hard job or a town bully could sympathize.
4903,elaboration,"Yes, I think one of the main reasons It's A Wonderful Life is so loved is that everyone can relate to the struggles of the main characters in some way. We see redemption for Jimmy Stewart, we can see redemption for ourselves and see that our lives are wonderful too."
4904,joking_sarcastic,And then he has to go up against Mr. Potter- he'd put Ebenezer Scrooge to shame. His name must top the naughty list every year.
4905,change,"Okay but wait, why do you let movies make you cry? I mean seriously it's all fake."
4906,continuation,"I haven't seen Citizen, but I generally don't like movies from that era."
4907,elaboration,"I haven't seen Citizen, but what era of movies are you talking about? I'm generally unaffected by movies."
4908,joking_sarcastic,"Ohhh yeah I've seen Citizen tons of times... on the store shelves, passing it up. Every. Time."
4909,change,"the sort of almost all knowing spiritual guides in movies always get me. An angel, some kind of higher being guiding the main person. Where they learn and do not  even know it, you know?"
4910,continuation,"I always like the whole looking back at their life movies, when they think it is worthless trope. There is always room to learn something and even room for a few good jokes regarding what might have been. I liked seeing what the world would of been like without him and then how it was with him. It's the best movie to watch if you need to have a good cry."
4911,elaboration,"I think it really worked. Since you got to see his cute little life, to an extent first, then the sort of darkness his being not born got. The angel really did it for me though, he always had something wise and funny to say, broke the movie up in to a bit of humor too."
4912,joking_sarcastic,"If an angel really did get his wings every time a bell rings, rich people calling for butlers would have a lot of celestial fans."
4913,change,That movie kind of reminds me of Casablanca. The movies were made around the same time.
4914,continuation,I know. Gregory Peck is such a good actor. He is so real and human. Things were so different and seemingly wholesome then.
4915,elaboration,"It's such a great Christmas movie, too! There is such a family element to it."
4916,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, ironically it's so wonderful it brings people to tears."
4917,change,"Yeah, the school has gotten really out of control. hasn't it?"
4918,continuation,"Yeah, it seems like tv is full of it, too."
4919,elaboration,We tried to watch a cartoon last week and it was so crass!
4920,joking_sarcastic,"Probably nothing they don't hear at school, though."
4921,change,It would not be good to cry when you are watching a Schwarzenegger action movie.
4922,continuation,It is good that children see that emotions are not off limits
4923,elaboration,Especially because those really big emotions when they run into them are sort of terrifyoing if they think the emotions ar weird or unusual in others.
4924,joking_sarcastic,"Sure, let them know that the parent is kind of dorky."
4925,change,"It's also nice when adults can capture some of the wonder and joy of childhood again, that's what I love about movies like Harry Potter."
4926,continuation,"Yeah. It's also good for kids to learn that it's valuable to be able to explore powerful emotions in fiction, it's not all about spectacle or crazy stories."
4927,elaboration,"If you think about it, being able to protect kids from tough emotions is a pretty modern thing. In older times kids would have had more experience with hardship and death, because families were bigger and health wasn't as good."
4928,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, and watching It's A Wonderful Life can help them learn about the full range of running a small business, too: from being stuck in a town you hate to being investigated for embezzlement."
4929,change,"It may be because my dad made us watch it every year and it became tradition, but Miracle on 34th Street was always my favorite Christmas story.  The old version not the remake."
4930,continuation,Seriously though you could always use it as a chance to talk about the stupid things we do when we've had too much to drink.
4931,elaboration,Last time we watched it we did have a good conversation about how even seemingly unimportant actions can end up having a huge impact on those around us.  The kids actually had some really good insights.  They surprise me sometimes.
4932,joking_sarcastic,"Right.  And they'll learn even if you hand over large sums of money to the most absent minded relative you have, and he loses it, everything will work out in the end, because Christmas."
4933,change,"Some movies aren't cast well, have you seen King Arthur?"
4934,continuation,"Yes, everything was well put together."
4935,elaboration,"They spend 5 weeks just trying to find the main cast, it took quite a while."
4936,joking_sarcastic,A movie that is well cast that is good? No way! Lol!
4937,change,Are you finished your homework for the day?
4938,continuation,He is amazing and extremely talented.  I was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie.
4939,elaboration,I loved when he was able to defeat the enemy but also show his concern for the everyday people.
4940,joking_sarcastic,"Yes, stomping the enemy sure showed his concern!"
4941,change,DO you go to the movies often?
4942,continuation,"Yeah, everyone was really into it. I'm glad we didn't wait for it on DVD."
4943,elaboration,I waited to see Spiderman at home and it wasn't very exciting.
4944,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, plus my kids always interrupt movies at home."
4945,change,Have you seen anything else good lately?
4946,continuation,I love him so much! I think he seems really down to earth.
4947,elaboration,"Yes, I think he's really overcome his drug and alcohol issues and I admire him for it."
4948,joking_sarcastic,I might even be able to give up drinking if it means being with him.
4949,change,"I do think he works better as the star of his own movie, when they try to make him share the screen with the other Avengers he ends up outshining the rest of them with his charisma."
4950,continuation,But at the end of the day it's really just a special effects spectacle.
4951,elaboration,"I'll grant you that it might be appealing from a wish-fulfillment perspective, who wouldn't want to be a billionaire genius celebrity heartthrob? But there just wasn't much meat to the story."
4952,joking_sarcastic,"Ooh, have you got a bit of a crush?"
4953,change,Who did you think made the best Bond villain?
4954,continuation,Right? The cheeky little car that Austin drove around was a direct homage to Bond's ride.
4955,elaboration,"And, don't even get me started on the ridiculous escapes from the jaws of death.  Classic!"
4956,joking_sarcastic,"It's sort of funny when you think about how Austin Powers is essentially a Mike Meyers, Inception fever dream."
4957,change,"Yeah, Mini Me was cool. I was at the grocery store the other day and I saw a mini me of myself, it was so bizarre."
4958,continuation,"Yeah! My favorite line is ""MOOOOOOOLE... MOLEY MOLEY MOLEY"""
4959,elaboration,"I don't know the badly burned joke but my favorite Austin Powers movie is Goldmember. ""Daddy wasn't there..."""
4960,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, the jokes are sooo ""funny,"" I love jokes about farts and sex."
4961,change,It seeems like a lot of movies are written for women these days.
4962,continuation,"I liked it a lot, but I enjoyed the recent remake the best."
4963,elaboration,Yes! The special effects were great and it was so funny!
4964,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, too bad it was all women, right? That whole hub-ub was so silly."
4965,change,I think all of the Monty Python moves are perfect for a game night.
4966,continuation,"Well that's true. I remember ""bring forth the shrubbery"" the best."
4967,elaboration,The really did an awesome job making it... well... extremely nerdy.
4968,joking_sarcastic,You honestly do need to be quite familiar with dry humor to enjoy it... That and how easy it is to use ketchup packets for fake blood.
4969,change,The funniest movie in my opinion is Austin Powers Goldmember.
4970,continuation,How has that been? Are you liking the freedom?
4971,elaboration,"Oh yeah that's right! Haha, maybe you'll grow out of the movie then."
4972,joking_sarcastic,It doesn't count as moving out when all you've done was move into your mother's basement.
4973,change,"What other sketch comedy troupes have successfully made it to the big screen?  Kids in the Hall?  You might think of spin-offs like movies starring former SNL cast members, like John Belushi and Animal House."
4974,continuation,Well it it is hard to make a follow-on that is good as the first.
4975,elaboration,"But you have to admit that both of them are better than ""The Meaning of Life""."
4976,joking_sarcastic,"Of course you would like a movie ridicules history  rather than one that makes fun of religion.   Name one  successful comedy movie based on religion."""
4977,change,"He is nice, that's true. I've had a lot of those types of characters in my life. And ones that I've hated, as well. Which ones do you just despise, in terms of TV characters?"
4978,continuation,"Yeah, that's one of the things I like best about the show, that his character is so appealing and really inspires affection from me. You know, he's just one of those TV icons who you actually want to interact with in real life, if you could."
4979,elaboration,"He does, I know what you mean. He would definitely be a good person to have in your life. I haven't always felt that way with the different actors over the years. Some of them I definitely like more than others."
4980,joking_sarcastic,"Love him, really? LOVE him? That's kind of a strong emotion considering you told me you have ""a lot of feeling"" for your mom and dad, but never mentioned love once in relation to them. But you ""love"" the fictional Dr. Who, huh? Interesting personality flaw of yours, for sure."
4981,change,"That 4th doc was good, but he was in another series also, I forgot the name."
4982,continuation,"Yes, I agree that there was something too them, and everyone has a favorite doc."
4983,elaboration,"Yes I remember many things about the older episodes that were still fun and enjoyable. The are still good backstory for the whole storyline. The 4th doc was one of the best, I think he is rated near the top as one of the favorites."
4984,joking_sarcastic,Oh no way. You can't be a true Who fan and like the 4th doctor! Lol. No way!
4985,change,I think his enthusiasm for the part was his saving grace.  What did you think of Sarah Jane Smith played by Elisabeth Sladen?
4986,continuation,"Wasn't he the fourth ""Doctor""?  He always seemed very zany to me."
4987,elaboration,"I was so young when he was the Doctor, but some of the jokes transcended age.  ""Would you care for a jelly baby?"""
4988,joking_sarcastic,"IF you liked people like Groucho Marks, then he was a genius."
4989,change,"I am not a trekkie, I just like sci-fi movies."
4990,continuation,"Yeah, I agree. Do you like other space shows like Star Wars?"
4991,elaboration,Star Wars and George Lucas films are my favorite.
4992,joking_sarcastic,More than Start Trek you trekkie?
4993,change,"I think the whole premise of light years is really cool, it allows the story arcs of time travel, with Spoc, to make a but more sense."
4994,continuation,"Almost all the episodes have some sort of outlandish, stellar, flair. But some really do just go the extra mile, and really put on a good show of showing more stellar aspects of the show."
4995,elaboration,"The ones where Kirk get stranded are always good, like the time he was on the planet that had no sense of time, then he had to fight the planet itself, which was actually a sludge monster."
4996,joking_sarcastic,"Sometimes they do go the extra mile in the episodes, or should I say the extra light year?"
4997,change,I have to admit it was nice to see Will Ferrell in a more family friendly role.  Most of his roles are a bit more on the raunchy side.  A few I had to turn off without finishing.  A bit much for me.
4998,continuation,Right.  There was a certain innocence to that movie that I think was really one of its biggest strengths.  The shower scene is a perfect example of it.
4999,elaboration,"I have heard that some people disagree though.  There is a theory that he actually was there because he knew she was naked.  The theory comes from the fact that earlier in the movie, he took a shower without any clothes so he must have known showers involved nudity.  I think people may be reading too much into it."
5000,joking_sarcastic,"We should throw a ELF themed Christmas party this year.  We could serve the four main food groups: candy, candy canes, candy corn, and syrup."
5001,change,"A lot of actors are getting into animated roles now, the best in my opinion is Andy Serkis. He is the actor who did Gollum in the Lord of The Rings."
5002,continuation,"Wait, which animated character did he do in the hobbit?"
5003,elaboration,"He is such an amazing actor, if you take a look at his serious roles, like in the Imitation game you realize how amazing he is"
5004,joking_sarcastic,He kind of looked like Smaug as well !
5005,change,"I hate when I am let down by the ending of it all though. Like HIMYM, I gave so much time to that show. Just to be let down by how it all ended up."
5006,continuation,"The slow pacing of romance really gets me into the show, or at least the romance aspect on sitcoms. It makes the rest of it seem more meaningful, I feel more like I am a part of their world if I have to wonder a bit."
5007,elaboration,"I like when the tension really builds. In the romance department, or just in general. A slow burn of the plot, but not so slow I lose interest in the series as a whole, you know?"
5008,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, you want the creators to know EXACTLY what you want them to do?"
5009,change,"Some of the comedies even play on the fact they do not think they are that funny, sort of hitting the fourth wall of comedy."
5010,continuation,"I like the contrast of humor in the two. They somehow compliment one another, maybe I can enjoy them both."
5011,elaboration,"I like the weird off dry humor British shows have,the sort of self aware kind. Self deprecating."
5012,joking_sarcastic,I do love to watch others that do not like themselves
5013,change,So do you still feel the UK version is better? I like the humor in both of them but the American version is just more up my ally.
5014,continuation,Exactly! It's something that most of us can relate to and gives some comic relief to our stressful day-to-day life.
5015,elaboration,"Yeah, it just makes it seem like life isn't so bad after all if we can just find some humor, and the romance is sooooo addictive."
5016,joking_sarcastic,"Yes, because office work is totally ""extradordinary""... those water cooler conversations, whew!"
5017,change,"My favorite actors are the ones that I can get confused by, with their work and personal life. Kevin Spacey, I do not know anything about him, he could be the any of the people he has played and I would believe it."
5018,continuation,They are both really funny. The big short really showed his comedic style well.
5019,elaboration,He plays a hapless sort of manager well. I like that he is not afraid to keep taking roles that are kind of similar.
5020,joking_sarcastic,"They are not roles. There is no Steve Carrell. Only Micheal Scott, posing as an actor."
5021,change,"I love the whole irreverent comedy genre. The real life kind, mixed with just a bit of whacky. Like community, or Parks and Rec. Things I could see happening in real life, just a little more out there."
5022,continuation,"They are both really good in their own rights. I love Michael Scott, he always had the wrong thing to say at the right moment to make you laugh your socks off."
5023,elaboration,"I think the comedic timing of both those shows was really what made them so good and so funny.There was always a good pacing to them. The jokes were played out in the right timing, never really over or under done. They both always seemed to turn the comedy back into itself somehow."
5024,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, how the turn tables"
5025,change,I hate when shoes go off on silly tangents just to keep making money from viewers. I like shows to end strong.
5026,continuation,"They are both good, and relied heavily on the humor of the ""boss"", in both. It really changed feel when Andy was the boss."
5027,elaboration,"It felt like they pushed it too far. I hate when series should and but they do not, like they just try to keep going even when the plot has run out."
5028,joking_sarcastic,"When they jump the shark, or in the case of the Office, jump the Micheal Scott."
5029,change,"Time travel can open up really fresh plots, but it can also allow for really cheesy and overly easy to conclude ones too."
5030,continuation,"A lot of movies and shows really twist the effects of time travel to their liking. Sometimes its a pocket universe, sometimes they just ruin everything."
5031,elaboration,"I think the repeat time lines are the most effective. Like the episode of Supernatural, or even groundhogs day. They give a chance to learn , with no lasting consequence."
5032,joking_sarcastic,I think Dean and his missing shoe would disagree.
5033,change,Action movies are what I can't get enough of . Makes my hesrt rsce.
5034,continuation,For me it has to be Stripes. Such a masterpiece
5035,elaboration,I think it's more about how the story is developed rather than how Bill plays his role.
5036,joking_sarcastic,How do completely grown people buy any of it though?
5037,change,"I feel like I do the same things on some days, De Ja Vu almost, like that movie. You ever have that happen?"
5038,continuation,"I enjoyed the latest repeater film, I think it was, ""Miss Perigrine's Home for Peculiar Children."""
5039,elaboration,"These kind of films are always interesting, on the edge of your seat kind of films. You keep thinking something is going to change, and you hope it does, but if never seems to help!"
5040,joking_sarcastic,"Whew, on any given day, I don't know if I'd want to repeat everything. Could you imagine having this conversation every day!"
5041,change,"The lets kill Hitler idea is always engaging. But what if we already sent someone to kill him, but it was another one. And a Hitler type always rises then. Confusing stuff."
5042,continuation,"Those movies has similar concepts. Ground hogs day had a more concrete structure, intro, development, learning from it all . Looper was more just a bunch of action and no real conclusion."
5043,elaboration,"The worse kind of time travel, or any type of time construct is when it ends no different than it began. Like, there was no point for the moive to even happen, nothing changed."
5044,joking_sarcastic,"So, I take it this time I came back Hitler won? I tried man, I tried to stop him."
5045,change,"Yeah -- Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Youtube Red -- which streaming service do you like the best? I'm partial to Netflix."
5046,continuation,Really? Something tells me they'll make a comeback.
5047,elaboration,"Absolutely, all the streaming services and everything are on their way up, I can't even remember the last time I flipped through channels."
5048,joking_sarcastic,Television? What's a television?
5049,change,"I think that may have been the appeal.The feeling of caring, but still being in the dark in the whole show. Similar to how the characters felt, or were showed to feel."
5050,continuation,"Lost has a lot going on, with the plot, subtext, mystery, more subtext, plot, characters. It is a very big and confusing show."
5051,elaboration,"There was a lot to get into, the show had so many story lines at one time. Separate, but some how they all pulled into one. But, they were really hard to navigate."
5052,joking_sarcastic,"So you got lost, in ""Lost"". Lostception."
5053,change,"Big magic, fantasy books are hard to condense. Take Lord of the Rings, the whole world could never have fit into just a couple books. It is really its own reality."
5054,continuation,"I think that even films that revolutionize the industry can still pale in how great they are, when compared to the book they come from."
5055,elaboration,"Books have a larger scope to show a story in though. They have as much or as little time as they need, no constraints on budgets when it comes to a fantasy world or effects. Take Harry Potter, the movies were huge, effects, just the whole thing all of them, massive. But the books were somehow bigger."
5056,joking_sarcastic,"I'm pretty sure that is because Rowling used magic to condense that world down into pages, stuff you muggles would not understand."
5057,change,Do you remember how we used to get around in strange cities before we all had smartphones?
5058,continuation,"I know. I mean, the special effects in both those movies seem really hokey now, but I'm sure they were exciting at the time. Do you remember how cool we thought the Internet was when it first came out in the early 90s?"
5059,elaboration,"I agree. I wonder how many people had access to color screens at the time, though. Or did that matter?"
5060,joking_sarcastic,Right. COLOR TV! It's the FUTURE!
5061,change,Did you see the new Oz movie they made with James Franco?
5062,continuation,"And it may not have been especially innovative, but making The Wizard of Oz a musical was a really smart choice. They could use that to communicate the emotion much better than a straightforward movie."
5063,elaboration,"The makeup was really good in The Wizard of Oz, too. I mean it's not like modern horror movie stuff, but the Scarecrow was really very effective, especially for the time."
5064,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, although Dorothy herself seemed pretty mellow about it."
5065,change,"I used to have a roommate in college who would do that. They'd knock on the bathroom door until you said something, ""Someone in there? Someone in there?  Someone in there?"""
5066,continuation,"It's like any other sitcom, we get used to the character quirks but don't like the idea of switching them out or adding any more."
5067,elaboration,"That show has been on for what, 10+ years or something it seems? I bet we could watch from the beginning now and laugh at the cool tech they used to love!"
5068,joking_sarcastic,"I could totally see myself living with someone like Sheldon and never be annoyed, not."
5069,change,"The hidden characters are always a cheeky touch. Like on Twin Peaks when agent Cooper is always talking to his secretary, but we never see her."
5070,continuation,"It really turns the table around on making fun of smart people, but it has lost a bit of its uniqueness. Some of it is still relevant, and kind of sweet."
5071,elaboration,"The side stories in that show are always the cutest. The soft kitty song, the marriages and the mother you never see."
5072,joking_sarcastic,Maybe his mom was MR. Wilson from Home Improvements wife.
5073,change,Did you ever see The Exorcist?
5074,continuation,I know! That scene really creeped me out. I'm also afraid to ever watch an unmarked tape again.
5075,elaboration,Yeah. Apparently a lot of people were scared by that scene in particular. I knew someone who slept with the lights on for weeks after she saw it.
5076,joking_sarcastic,I'm the monster in your TV and I'm here to eat your soul! Gah!
5077,change,"Scary surroundings, towns, the hills have eyes, the fog, anything beyond human control, things about towns and nature, those are really scary too. It just seems like they can not do anything, what can a guy do about killer fog?"
5078,continuation,"Rosemary's baby was and still is just really scary. I think it helped the genre at the time, and led the way for things like the Ring, and the ones that have came since, to really be in the fore front of movies, helped the popularity of scary movies."
5079,elaboration,"The ones that involve kids are always the scariest. Anytime there is a scary movie with a kid under 12, I just freak."
5080,joking_sarcastic,"SO if you ever have a kid and they say , ""but mommy, I am your daughter"", you are just going to run for the hills...but be careful since the hills have eyes. Ba dum, ha."
5081,change,"The way they did it in Star Trek was just dumb, they tried to have their cake and eat it too by using time travel to make it both a continuation and a reimagining at the same time."
5082,continuation,"The original inspiration for Star Wars was the movie serials, so the idea of an ongoing story is right there in the DNA."
5083,elaboration,"Yeah, as long as they're graceful about the transitions and make each new one about its own thing rather than trying to rehash the first one I think sequels are a perfectly valid type of film."
5084,joking_sarcastic,Just picture what a reimagined Star Wars would look like. Luke would be a mopey goth kid and Obi-Wan would be a sassy wise-cracking old lady.
5085,change,"What gets to me is when they do a reboot of a movie that's still pretty new. It seems like only yesterday we had the Sam Raimi Spider-man, but now we're on the third version!"
5086,continuation,"Yeah, I can understand that. Even if sequels make sense you still need a lot of good original stuff to be the starting point."
5087,elaboration,"The problem is that movies are so expensive now that they think they can only afford to make them if they're guaranteed to be successful, so they try to make copies of things that already succeeded."
5088,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, but people have been making that same complaint for years, why don't people come up with original things to complain about anymore?"
5089,change,"Disney may be a bit too cutesy, but even their cute little secondary characters usually add at least a bit of plot to the movies, like Olaf, he was adorable but also useful."
5090,continuation,"I think there may be reason to worry about another Jar Jar Binks type. An added too cute character, aimed at kids just to sell merchandise. But, I hope they keep the feel of Star Wars intact, even if they add cutesy Disney type secondary characters."
5091,elaboration,"The ewoks from the original three star wars films were actually created for marketing, something cutesy to sell to kids."
5092,joking_sarcastic,"Ok, Jar Jar, just ruin Star Wars a little more for me."
5093,change,"Ha! No, like Robin to Batman. Or even Chewie to Han. They are actually a part of the plot, vital to the plot."
5094,continuation,"I do not really get too into the all war no side kick fun of movies, I like a good side kick. If the side kick is not too cringe inducing, I think they can really add a healthy dose of comic relief."
5095,elaboration,"If the sidekick is reliable and believable , and serves a purpose in the film, a real purpose."
5096,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, like Jar Jar Binks? He was so needed for the plot...."
5097,change,I hate the way some shows break up the season right in the midst of drama. They sometimes lose too much momentum.
5098,continuation,"The drawn out suspense crime dramas always hold my attention. I like sometimes knowing the outcome, but not knowing how they got there."
5099,elaboration,"How to get away with murder, tells you what happens, but somehow you still want to stay around and watch, to learn how it happen."
5100,joking_sarcastic,I love being left on the hook for months at a time...
5101,change,"Speaking of TV, have you been watching the finals of The Voice?  There are some amazingly talented young people on there"
5102,continuation,I do and there are some good ones on that I watch regularly like Modern Family
5103,elaboration,There are a few really good sitcoms that last for years and many others that are gone after a season or two.  The writing is the make or break element
5104,joking_sarcastic,If they were to make a sitcom about my family life no one would watch it because it is so boring.
5105,change,Sex addiction is not a premonition to cooking meth.
5106,continuation,Did you know Anthony Hopkins once wrote to Bryan Cranston praising his acting ability?
5107,elaboration,"Yeah, I read about that somewhere. he said something like ""Your acting is the best I've seen."""
5108,joking_sarcastic,"Kinda ironic given his previous role as a completely inept father he played in ""Malcolm in the middle."" But, I guess it was a bit premonition in that he played a sex addict on that show."
5109,change,"I love murder shows in general. Especially when they show how it happen, from start to finish, really amazes me the imagination people can have."
5110,continuation,"Both those shows really explore the mixture between kids from one side of the track and adults form the other, showing them a different life. Even if it ended up not being the best for them."
5111,elaboration,"I like shows that show that the sort of rich and fabulous life, of the educated and sort of posh, is not always better than the blue collar life, at least in general. Like, it may not end so good for rich folk."
5112,joking_sarcastic,"I would rather be rich enough to get away with murder, than so poor my only chance was trying to cover it up."
5113,change,"Some movies are either just too awful, or just too great, to have a sequel."
5114,continuation,I like to be confused at times. Good Will Hunting and all Damon's work are really similar to one another.
5115,elaboration,"Most the one he and Ben Afleck write, have really similar story and over all just have the same feel."
5116,joking_sarcastic,"Batman v. Superman, but in Boston, Good Will Hunting 2."
5117,change,"Open ended endings sort of drive me nuts. When they end the show, but leave it open for a movie or revival, like Entourage."
5118,continuation,"I hate when shows build up the confusion and plot, but then get canceled before they have a real solution."
5119,elaboration,"There are a lot of series that really get deep into the web of plot, then boom canceled.  We never get closure."
5120,joking_sarcastic,"I love when the closure is they were dead the whole time, just makes me so LOST."
5121,change,"Every drama needs a bit of relief,if not they get too stagnant. Look at Supernatural, lot of drama but lots of running jokes too."
5122,continuation,"Greys has just so much drama, Scrubs has drama but at least it lets up on drama with comedy."
5123,elaboration,"Greys is a really serious take on hospitals, mixed in with just a lot or overly used romance. I like a bit more comedy."
5124,joking_sarcastic,"Just imagine if Grey, from fifty shades, had to end up in the hospital of Greys anatomy."
5125,change,"I think it's because the writer is so good. She has a couple shows right, How to Get Away with Murder is one."
5126,continuation,There is always a drama about the medical field.
5127,elaboration,"I've seen quite a few spin offs, related to this series. I can't see them taking it offline anytime soon, but maybe redirecting to a spin off."
5128,joking_sarcastic,"Just so we are clear, I will NEVER be traveling to Seattle because of this series."
5129,change,I wonder how low Grey's Anatomy will be on TV.  Sometime great shows just run their course.  I remember when that happened with The Good Wife.
5130,continuation,They go overboard with the drama nearly every week but that's what makes it so addictive.
5131,elaboration,The writers do a great job because you don't want to miss a single episode because there is so much happening in their lives.
5132,joking_sarcastic,If they did a program about what it's really like in a typical hospital day after day it would put people to sleep due to boredom
5133,change,I sometimes hate that they case overly attractive people in almost all the roles. It takes away a bit from the realness of shows sometimes.
5134,continuation,"The whole hospital seems to just be covered in nothing but attractive, misfortuned people."
5135,elaboration,"I think it is meant to play into the drama, make if feel more real world."
5136,joking_sarcastic,"If the real world had that many doctors that looked like they did, I would be sick a lot more often..."
5137,change,"Exactly. Films sometimes just create their own pocket world from books, take a huge creative license, sometimes ending in just utter stupidity."
5138,continuation,"I think it is hard to convey the feeling of a book to film.Someone is going to be mad, since everyone experiences a book differently."
5139,elaboration,"Yeah, people see the characters in their mind as one thing, have a feel for them, then boom, on screen a whole different idea."
5140,joking_sarcastic,"Like, he who shall not be named's nose?"
5141,change,Do you know that it is actually based on the War of roses that happened in medieval England?
5142,continuation,The Drama is amazing specially when it deals with death and how the different characters react to the deaths of so many main characters.
5143,elaboration,I think it is an amazing drama because even though it is a fantasy series it draws inspiration from actual historical events.
5144,joking_sarcastic,Of course it is a good drama with all those main characters dying every other episode
5145,change,"Ha, no. Maybe the semi bad guys. I think sometimes I kind of understand the Lannister father. He had a lot to lose."
5146,continuation,The way he weaves the violence and story into that setting is really grabbing. It draws you in.
5147,elaboration,"The whole set up builds so well, I find myself concerned with the emotions of dragons. The welfare of wolfs. Heck, sometimes it is so engrossing I almost root for the bad guy."
5148,joking_sarcastic,"If you say....if you say you liked that little king, I am going to burn your fire and your ice."
5149,change,Lord of the Rings is a similar one I adore.
5150,continuation,Plus the treatment of women in that realm is not my thing.
5151,elaboration,"Yeah, I really can't imagine the smell, especially because of all of the death in that story."
5152,joking_sarcastic,That's because you're just lucky I showered today.
5153,change,"I think they over did a good bit in that movie, but underplayed other parts."
5154,continuation,The two are really different worlds. They are both huge and show the story in a light the other does not. Neville always seems to get sort of undercut.
5155,elaboration,The secondary characters in that movie really did not get the recognition they deserved at times.
5156,joking_sarcastic,"DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET HARRY, he asked gently."
5157,change,"I guess I'm jaded, I grew up near an amusement park so I have a hard time treating them like an exciting special destination."
5158,continuation,"No, but all the buzz I hear about it is really positive. I don't think I've heard anyone say anything bad about it."
5159,elaboration,"I'd like to go, too, but it seems so expensive."
5160,joking_sarcastic,You haven't lived until you've chugged a butterbeer.
5161,change,"Thinking about the Harry Potter movies makes me miss Alan Rickman, he was such a powerful presence in those films."
5162,continuation,"That's from the one with Mad-Eye Moody, right? I really liked him, he was a lot of fun."
5163,elaboration,"Is that the one from the Tri-Wizard Tournament? Did the book do a better job explaining how Harry ended up in the tournament, because I don't think I quite followed that in the movie."
5164,joking_sarcastic,"Wow, the books must do a much better job of making the details stick, I don't even remember what a Hungarian Horntail is!"
5165,change,Did you know that with 2001: A Space Odyssey the sequel novel was written as a sequel to the movie adaptation rather than the original novel?
5166,continuation,"Jack Nicholson's performance is so amazing, it's hard to take your eyes off the screen."
5167,elaboration,"I think they're both good, but in different ways. The Shining is definitely an example of outstanding filmmaking, but the way The Shining is written really makes the idea of intrusive thoughts seem very creepy."
5168,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, the book really needed an editor. I get that all work and no play is an important theme, but do you really need to hammer it over our heads so many times?"
5169,change,What do you think of comedy movies?
5170,continuation,"Agreed, I could barely make it through the first one.  I thought it was never going to end."
5171,elaboration,"How did you lie the Hobbits in the movie?  For me, they were the stars of the movies."
5172,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, Hobbit, big feet, Frodo was the star for sure."
5173,change,I still liked him in the movie though. Ian McKellan is incredible. He is such a strong and powerful actor.
5174,continuation,"Yes, I feel as though they did that with Aragorn as well. His significance as a savior figure really wasn't shown as much as it should have been. You wouldn't get what the sword and the white tree meant if you haven't read the books."
5175,elaboration,They did that with Albus Dumbledore with the Harry Potter books too! Albus Dumbledore isn't as complex and ethically grey of a character as he is in the books.
5176,joking_sarcastic,"In the books it says he's like six feet tall, so it'd be easy to diminish him, huh?"
5177,change,"We've had a long break in vacations, I agree. But with the new job and having less time, we can revisit this later."
5178,continuation,"I agree, it seems like they are always going somewhere new, or something horrible and exciting is happening, image living in that kind of world, right?"
5179,elaboration,Like how Harry had an excuse to get away from his horrible co-habitants? I'd wish to be swept away if I lived like that. Where would you like to be swept away to?
5180,joking_sarcastic,"I sure as heck wouldn't be hanging around Harry thought, that guy has horrible luck!"
5181,change,"Have you shown the kids? What did they think? I don't think I'll ever show my kids, if they're easily spooked like I am... I'm such a scaredy-cat."
5182,continuation,"Absolutely! I don't have kids, but I know I'll share it with them when I do!"
5183,elaboration,"Yeah, but I think it's a little scary at times for some kids. How old do you think they should be to watch Harry Potter films?"
5184,joking_sarcastic,"Ohhh yeah, because all these two headed animals and noseless people and black demons are sooooo good for children."
5185,change,"Pirates of the Caribbean, is actually based on a ride, similar to It's a small world ride, not the other way around."
5186,continuation,"The whole world of Harry Potter is so big, it needed books, films and a whole real world to even try to contain it."
5187,elaboration,"There are some really massive worlds that now have rides associated with them, even some movies that came from big rides."
5188,joking_sarcastic,As long as its a small world does not turn into a Hollywood film. I am ok with that. Those dolls are creepy.
5189,change,She was pretty good in Black Swan. Did you watch that?
5190,continuation,Wasn't she the voice for Meg Griffin in the Family Guy? She was so good in that.
5191,elaboration,The voice for these animated characters are so important to bring out these personalities. I loved Dawyne Johnson in Moana. He was great!
5192,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, her voice sure can put me to sleep."
5193,change,"Some of my friends said I should get into Japanese anime, but they say I should watch with subtitles rather than the English dubs."
5194,continuation,"It should be a spice that brightens things up, not the whole meal."
5195,elaboration,I think the important thing is making sure the story is strong enough to stand on its own. If the only thing a movie has going for it is the cast then it's a problem.
5196,joking_sarcastic,"They should try for the best of both worlds by having the famous actors do unrecognizable voices, like Mike Myers doing his Scottish accent for Shrek."
5197,change,"Films sometimes add those unneeded characters, just to have a famous face. I wonder why they do that to a film that is already established?"
5198,continuation,"Some of those cartoons are just a pot luck of celebs, usually ones kids do not even care about."
5199,elaboration,"A lot of shows seem to add unneeded celebs, maybe to hype up the hype for their release."
5200,joking_sarcastic,"I think the rock was a hype for Fast And the Furious, but some how is now ROCK solid in the franchise...get it?"
5201,change,"Not any different than adding actors to movies that aren't animated just to make them good. It's like adding a salad to Mc'Donalds, doesn't make the whole restaurant healthy."
5202,continuation,The voices make the films. Might not be crappy to some because of the actors they chose.
5203,elaboration,"Not just Dreamworks though right? Think about Disney, Pixar, Marvel, anything in the ""new universe"" module. Adding new people you don't know, doesn't sell anymore."
5204,joking_sarcastic,"I agree, but if you think about it, I would not sound nearly as good as Woody in Toy Story as Tom Hanks did."
5205,change,"What do you think of the movie ""Trolls""?  My grandson made me watch it ten times in a row."
5206,continuation,I love seeing the names of everyone playing the characters in the credits.  The fun part is seeing if I guessed right on who was playing who.
5207,elaboration,The graphics in these movies is unreal too.  I find animation to be quite fascinating and intriguing.
5208,joking_sarcastic,"Haha, everyone said the girl in ""The Incredibles"" looked like my daughter. There really was a resemblance between the two."
5209,change,"I think mixing the real world in with kids shows really helps kids learn more efficiently. Think about Bill Nye and his show, it really taught kids a lot, but was also aimed at kids. He would be a great cartoon."
5210,continuation,"It is a challenge to try to fit a cartoon to a real, big time actor or celeb."
5211,elaboration,"I liked when they add a famous person, just not exactly an actor. Maybe a singer or a politician."
5212,joking_sarcastic,I am sure George Bush is lining up to be in Toy Story five...
5213,change,If you want a kids' show that showcases real life I'm not sure where you'd look.
5214,continuation,They never let the villain win in kids' shows. Good always has to prevail.
5215,elaboration,I have never understood why good always wins in kids' shows because in real life that doesn't always happen. It can be a bitter pill to swallow.
5216,joking_sarcastic,"The Incredibles is so different than other kids' movies. Then again, it's not."
5217,change,"I get your point, though. Are there any movies you could watch a hundred times without getting tired of them?"
5218,continuation,"Yeah, there's somebody for everyone to relate to. And the themes involve the kinds of problems that kids actually deal with, like trying to figure out how hard they should try to fit in."
5219,elaboration,"And the adult characters are also fun and engaging, even for kids who might think it's babyish to identify with child characters."
5220,joking_sarcastic,"Although, if you think about it, children with superpowers is basically a horror genre."
5221,change,Now that horror movies are all about shock and jump scares I don't think that works anymore.
5222,continuation,"Well I don't think there's anything wrong with them, but she might. Has she mentioned any other movies that she liked?"
5223,elaboration,"It's fine if she's into it, but you won't be getting any cuddles if she ends up walking out on the movie!"
5224,joking_sarcastic,"Good point, maybe you could supercharge the romance by watching Saw."
5225,change,Maybe you could do something else besides watch movies if you want to play it safe. Do you ever play board games?
5226,continuation,"I mean, there are the really cheesy hokey ones, but some of the newer ones like Bridesmaids are really funny. I thought so and I'm not a big romantic comedy person either."
5227,elaboration,Maybe you should just play it safe and ask her what she wants to see. That way if she's not into romantic comedies she doesn't have to suffer through one.
5228,joking_sarcastic,I don't blame her. They make me want to punch myself in the face just to keep myself entertained.
5229,change,"I like films that are are equally funny and romantic, like The Princess Bride. It is the perfect combo of laugh out loud and heart wrenching."
5230,continuation,"It is a show that will make just about anyone cry. I would not go with that on a first date... maybe something sweet, but lighter and a bit more romance."
5231,elaboration,"Romance, with a bit of comedy if always a hit for a date."
5232,joking_sarcastic,Hopefully the romance of the date will not end in comedy though.
5233,change,"Is there a better movie for the time period with that kind of message, that kind of creativity and vision in the storyline? Maybe Wizard of Oz, maybe...but I think this movie takes the crown."
5234,continuation,"They had quite the vision whoever produced that movie. Its one of those movies that are just timeless. It couldn't be made over again, there is no need to try to alter perfection."
5235,elaboration,On the surface it's a story of one man and how he has to lose it all to gain it all back and realize how important his friends and family are but on the other hand it's so full of hidden metaphors and innuendos.
5236,joking_sarcastic,"It sure does make you cry. I think it keeps Kleenex in business. Forget bell ringing and angel wings, ""Every time the movie plays, the Kleenex stock price goes up"""
5237,change,"I like those old shows that had to end well, to an extent. Had to show some kind of lesson. I like learning lessons, very wholesome."
5238,continuation,"The show is a real emotional roller-coaster. Some of the characters are just so bad at what they do, but some how still likable."
5239,elaboration,"Around that time it was pretty popular to either show German types as scary, hard bad guys, or more bumbling but sweet bafoons, maybe something to do with the war. Real turn on German, Austrian and so on tropes."
5240,joking_sarcastic,"Uncle Billy, an interrogation. After? He gives you free cookies and milk.Then loses all your savings."
5241,change,"Jimmy Stewart is also good in Double Indemnity, but that's a much darker movie."
5242,continuation,"I've never seen the movie of Gift of the Magi, but I'm pretty sure we read the short story in English class once."
5243,elaboration,"Yeah, older Christmas stories seem to have a warmer human element, modern ones just don't strike the same chord with me, even when they're trying to be heartwarming."
5244,joking_sarcastic,If they ever do a modern Gift of the Magi reboot they could get M. Night Shyamalan to direct. What a twist!
5245,change,"Mr. Potter's kind of a cartoonish villain, though. Why is he so invested in controlling the town? It's not like it's going to make him richer to have everyone under his thumb."
5246,continuation,"Yeah, there are so many points where they build it up so he almost gets what he wants and then the rug gets pulled out from under him, you just know exactly how you would feel in the same situation."
5247,elaboration,"Some of the romance stuff is a little hokey, though, you probably actually need to be Jimmy Stewart to make some of those lines work."
5248,joking_sarcastic,"Although it probably would have been more exciting if there was a subplot where Mary turned out to be a werewolf, to tie it in to that whole ""lasso the moon"" thing."
5249,change,"Sometimes, though, I like to just need a little escapist fun to take my mind of my problems."
5250,continuation,"Yeah. Although, to be honest, if I was having a hard time I doubt my entire town would show up to rally around me."
5251,elaboration,"I guess so. But some people are actually pretty terrible, manipulating and using people all the time. I wonder if watching it makes people like that feel bad about themselves."
5252,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, although maybe the sketchy banking situation in Bedford Falls should have been the canary in the coal mine for the whole subprime mortgage crisis."
5253,change,"Exactly. I like stories that lean so far out into left field they some how seem to make more sense, in the sense they are non-sense, you know? Like just crazy enough to work."
5254,continuation,"I like the whole appeal of a movie that has a lot of introspection. The looking into ones self, then out, to find the meaning of life."
5255,elaboration,"I like when the meaning of life ends up being either overly obvious, love and family, or my favorite, just utterly insane."
5256,joking_sarcastic,Like the meaning of life being 42? Hitchikers guide to the Galaxy.
5257,change,"It really plays the rags to riches, but not really happiness trope too. Like money can't really buy you happiness, in a weird way similar to Mr.Deed,"
5258,continuation,"Anytime a movie makes me reflect on my self, and cry, I think it is a classic."
5259,elaboration,"There are a lot of older films that really pull the emotion out for me, Like citizen Kane."
5260,joking_sarcastic,"If you say Rosebud with you last breathe, I will know why."
5261,change,"Vampire movies are a whole other ball game of emotions. The are so macabre, but sometimes they pull you in just enough to care, then book more death and sorrow, no real let up."
5262,continuation,"Crying, laughing, angels, I love stuff that takes me on a journey of emotions."
5263,elaboration,"As long as the journey is paced, some shows just go from dull, to sad, to sadder before I really care for the people in the plot. Too gothic too fast."
5264,joking_sarcastic,"So, you were not emotionally involved in Edward being dead, before the show even began."
5265,change,"The whole switch a roo body change is always funny, like Freaky Friday."
5266,continuation,I love emotional films. Especially ones that can add a bit of humor.
5267,elaboration,"I like the angel trope too. The movie Down to Earth always gets me, funny and moving."
5268,joking_sarcastic,"I am pretty sure the main guy in that show wished he would of been moving a bit faster, since he ended up in another guys body."
5269,change,What's your favorite movie?
5270,continuation,"Casablanca makes me cry too. I try not to, but I can't help it! I just find the movie to be so relatable!"
5271,elaboration,Movies from that time period have several similarities. I noticed quite a few.
5272,joking_sarcastic,I can't believe you've watched Casablanca! That movie is awful.
5273,change,"It's strange, because older movies tend to feel like they're set in a specific time period, but a lot of them were just contemporary for the time they were made."
5274,continuation,"You mean Jimmy Stewart? Yeah, he is good. He has such a distinctive voice that it's easy to just think of people doing a silly impression of him, but when you're actually watching him on screen he really sells it."
5275,elaboration,"Wait, Gregory Peck? Are you thinking of To Kill a Mockingbird?"
5276,joking_sarcastic,Or maybe they were just better at hiding the darker side of things.
5277,change,Family holiday movies are awesome. I really like watching Groundhog Day in the winter with my family too.
5278,continuation,"My whole family likes it. I think it's because it caters to everyone. Parents who have lost their jobs, kids with angry parents, people who don't like Christmas."
5279,elaboration,"I like watching it year round. It's more than Christmas, it reminds me of the beauty of life."
5280,joking_sarcastic,It's the only good thing about Christmas for me. Watching it is better than stuffing myself with food!
5281,change,"What I do like is nature documentaries. Those are pretty wholesome and the kids seem to find them interesting enough to sit still through, plus we learn things."
5282,continuation,I know! It's like they always go for the lowest common denominator. A movie can be uplifting and entertaining if they'd just put in some effort.
5283,elaboration,"It's because they market directly to kids now, and kids haven't had a chance to develop sophisticated tastes yet."
5284,joking_sarcastic,"I thought you were pro-crass? Oh, no, my mistake, you said you were procrastinating."
5285,change,"I heard that they're going to be opening up one of those magnet schools that focuses on math and science soon, I'm going to have to check that out and see if it would be a better fit for my kids than the regular one."
5286,continuation,"In some ways you're not the only person raising your kids, every other parent in town is, too."
5287,elaboration,"Yeah, but just because they get some exposure that way doesn't mean I want to double down on it."
5288,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, the walls of those classrooms are so thin, I don't know how they can learn math over all the racket."
5289,change,"I like that the big action movies now are superhero movies, they're at least a bit brighter and more uplifting than just shooting everybody."
5290,continuation,Not even when he's sinking into the molten metal at the end of Terminator 2 and he gives the thumbs up?
5291,elaboration,I suppose those are for the parts of the emotional spectrum that It's a Wonderful Life doesn't cover.
5292,joking_sarcastic,"But some of his one-liners are things of sublime beauty, who wouldn't be moved to tears by them? ""Sully, when I promised to kill you last? I lied."""
5293,change,"I have a hard time getting them to watch anyway, they see it's in black and white and they just roll their eyes."
5294,continuation,"That makes sense. As long as it doesn't get out of hand, of course."
5295,elaboration,"I guess so. But it's hard to let go of the instinct to think it's my job to keep them from being upset, like when they were babies."
5296,joking_sarcastic,But if they don't practice suppressing their emotions now how will they ever get into the Vulcan Academy?
5297,change,I think cartoons sometimes are even more able to hit an emotional nerve. I still remember the feeling I felt when Simba's dad dies.
5298,continuation,"I think movies are a good outlet to express emotions for everyone. To sort of ease into emotions, to help you understand what you feel. Especially kids, to lessen the blow a bit of real emotions."
5299,elaboration,"If you get the right movie, some movies are just too emotional for kids to watch. Period. Sometimes, even shows aimed for kids are just too emotional for younger kids, too much emotion too strongly."
5300,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, I cried three times in Finding Nemo... I was twenty two."
5301,change,"Worlds that adults can get lost in, especially ones that are more aimed at kids, always show a really good mark on the writer, director and the whole crew involved with it. Like Harry Potter."
5302,continuation,"Big emotional movies are a great way for grown ups to get that feeling again, that wonderment and the feel of looking at the world as this fantastic place. Harry Potter is still so relevant, and awe inspiring for all ages."
5303,elaboration,"Expansive worlds, in books and movies seem to grab at adults sense of wonder. Even ones that are beyond belief, like Lord of the Rings, all those films make me feel like I am just seeing things about the world it is in for the first time."
5304,joking_sarcastic,I am pretty sure that is the ring talking.
5305,change,"Sometimes stories that are targeted at teenagers get too emotional though, and they end up wallowing in it."
5306,continuation,"Right. It's easy to get so caught up in all the surface elements of what makes a story appealing and forget about why we like stories in the first place, they're about people."
5307,elaboration,"So many stories that are targeted at kids are so shallow, it's a wonder anybody ever develops more sophisticated tastes."
5308,joking_sarcastic,"I don't know, maybe it would have been better if Mr. Potter had a giant robot with a huge death ray."
5309,change,"The whole orphan thing was a big deal, super rags to riches, but in a child way. Oliver Twist, Orhan Annie. Kids needed hope then, so did adults."
5310,continuation,"I think it can help lessen the blow. Most kids today do not see hard ship in daily life, some do, but for the most part they are protected and safe."
5311,elaboration,"The old time movies, the kids in them were going thru more than adult. Oliver Twist? Anything around the great depression."
5312,joking_sarcastic,Can I have some oar classic film please?
5313,change,I tried starting a small business once; what a bust. It's too much work for too little an opportunity for success. Have you ever thought about starting a business?
5314,continuation,I know absolutely nothing about running businesses myself so it's a learning experience for everyone.
5315,elaboration,I doubt kids even totally notice the business themes; they're just there for the kiddo stuff.
5316,joking_sarcastic,"Yes because children need to learn about all of that crap at a young age, uh huh."
5317,change,Why didn't you like the remake of Miracle on 34th Street? I've found that some remakes are actually improvements on the originals!
5318,continuation,I've actually never seen Miracle on 34th Street! I just remember Santa on the cover.
5319,elaboration,"Miracle on 34th Street looks good, but I think A Christmas Story is where it's at."
5320,joking_sarcastic,"More like Miracle on SANTA Street, haha, am I right?"
5321,change,"But I also don't want to make the kids grow up too fast, you know? They only get to be children once, they deserve a chance to enjoy it while they can."
5322,continuation,"Yeah, that's true. George gets a little angry and mean, but he doesn't turn into an over-the-top monster, so it's relatable."
5323,elaboration,"Yeah, and that's maybe a better approach than treating alcohol like some mysterious forbidden fruit."
5324,joking_sarcastic,I think I'd need a few shots of whiskey to settle my nerves enough to discuss the realities of alcohol.
5325,change,"I was talking to my kids about something that happened in politics the other day, and it seemed like the things they were saying were smarter than half the people they have on those cable news shows."
5326,continuation,That's great. When I watch old movies my kids mostly just roll their eyes and ask when it will be over so they can use the TV to play video games.
5327,elaboration,"Yeah, kids change so much as they grow up. It's so easy to run on auto-pilot and forget that they're getting smarter and more knowledgeable all the time."
5328,joking_sarcastic,"The things that come out of my kids' mouths surprise me too, but usually in a not-so-nice way."
5329,change,Do you tend to buy DVDs a lot or do you have Netflix at all?
5330,continuation,"When I went with my friend, there was no one else in our small-town theater during the day."
5331,elaboration,"I think being surrounded by people while viewing a movie can completely change how you think of said movie, depending on how others react."
5332,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, I was waiting for it to be on VHS."
5333,change,"When it comes down to it, the books are better most of the time."
5334,continuation,I feel like the rewrites of movies are never as good as the originals.
5335,elaboration,I prefer to watch movies at home because crouds always stress me out.
5336,joking_sarcastic,"Plus, you can eat all the popcorn that you want!"
5337,change,Many Hollywood stars are self-involved egomaniacs but not all of them.  Look at Tom Hanks for example
5338,continuation,I agree.  I saw a segment on the news where he met with a young boy who had a prosthetic arm and it was really touching
5339,elaboration,Some celebrities do these things for the p.r. value but I think he's really sincere
5340,joking_sarcastic,The media will probably rip him for it or say he was high at the time he visited the young boy
5341,change,What about the other Avengers? Who is your favorite besides Iron Man?
5342,continuation,He really does have a charisma that is unmatched in Hollywood.
5343,elaboration,"I think his acting has really come a long way from his older movies. Do you remember him in ""Chances Are""? Great flick!"
5344,joking_sarcastic,I wonder if Iron Man knows how to actually iron....I could use a hot maid around here!
5345,change,"Eh, not all movies need to be dark, brooding dramas. It's OK to make art that's straightforward and accessible."
5346,continuation,There definitely was! It was all about Tony learning to take responsibility for his actions.
5347,elaboration,"You have to think about the story from Obadiah Stane's perspective, to understand how so much resentment could build up for his partner's golden-boy son."
5348,joking_sarcastic,"Heartthrob, eh? Are we maybe edging into lady doth protest too much territory?"
5349,change,"Films with time travel, that play on how much things have changes, like a million not being that much at the time he was in when he asked for it, always make for really funny situations."
5350,continuation,The spoof movies sometimes led the way for the best quotable and supporting roles. Mini me was just a treasure trove of quotables.
5351,elaboration,"I think that whole show was a great outlet for one liners, Dr. Evil, was just amazing in the whole thing."
5352,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, One Million dollars....worth of quotes."
5353,change,Did you see how they incorporate Beyonce into Goldmember? What do you think of her as an actress?
5354,continuation,"I think my favorite was the first, and the whole scene with the Fembots fighting to that one song, ""and these boots will walk all over you..."""
5355,elaboration,"The ""I'm very badly burned."" was from the first movie, where Dr. Evil sent Will Ferrel's character through the trap door under his seat to the lave fire pit."
5356,joking_sarcastic,"I could tell you where the badly burned joke came from, for 1 million dollars! *raises pinky to mouth*"
5357,change,"I like the way more women have been getting diverse comedy leads in films. A lot of different kinds of women, with varying comedy styles have really been rising in popularity."
5358,continuation,"I think some times a remake can loose alot of the initial appeal, the freshness of the first film."
5359,elaboration,There are a lot of movies being rewritten with an all female lead cast in mind.
5360,joking_sarcastic,"At least if the film gets lost, the leads are not too proud to ask for directions."
5361,change,"A lot of times they just remake these superhero epics for money. Look at the hulk, spiderman, they even have another spiderman! It is just too soon, to much and makes no sense."
5362,continuation,"The film has a good base, and I think the cast did well, but it was a film that does not need to be remade. It did it right the first time."
5363,elaboration,"There are very few movies that hit the mark twice, the original and the sequel. Way less that are good when fully remade, with a whole new cast."
5364,joking_sarcastic,"So, the ninety different spidermen... not doing it for you?"
5365,change,There are a few films from around that time that really hold up their comedy regardless of generational gaps.
5366,continuation,"Monty Python really bridged the gap between sort of high brow and low brow humor, it really hits the mark on all levels of funny, for just about any occasion."
5367,elaboration,"Monty Python some how can reach fifteen year old kids, decades after its release and at the same time make a posh fifty year old laugh just as loud."
5368,joking_sarcastic,Nobody expects the longevity of Monty Phython....or the Spanish Inquisition...
5369,change,"That scene is funny. I really like all of the Monty Plython movies though. And the other ones are funny, but not as well known as the Holy Grail."
5370,continuation,"Yes I love that scene. I want to act it out every time I go gardening. You can tell I have a lot of shrubs, haha."
5371,elaboration,"For me, it's ""The knights who say Nicht"". That scene is amazing."
5372,joking_sarcastic,"I just can't get that joke. My humor needs to be actually funny, you know?"
5373,change,It's all right. It's really kind of a transitional thing. What I really want is to move to New York.
5374,continuation,"Yeah, it's great. I love being able to do things on my own terms and not feel like anyone is breathing down my neck."
5375,elaboration,"It's OK, having to earn enough to cover the rent kind of sucks, though."
5376,joking_sarcastic,"Ick, no, keep it away! Freedom, terrible, terrible freedom!"
5377,change,"I do not know of any other groups that successfully made the switch, Theater troupes on the other hand, I know a lot"
5378,continuation,"When I think of comedy troupes, I think the broken lizard comedy group successfully made it to the big screen with Super Troopers."
5379,elaboration,"Well, Comedy is best suited to the short sketches rather than movies"
5380,joking_sarcastic,"The blues brothers was amazing, not so much for the acting but for the number of cars they destroyed"
5381,change,Can you name a B movie that was actually any good?
5382,continuation,"Sister Act was a successful comedy about Catholic Nuns.  Whoopi was funny, funny, funny."
5383,elaboration,How about Evan almighty?  Morgan Freeman was great in this movie.
5384,joking_sarcastic,I think we would be locked up if we started building an arc.
5385,change,"That is strong writing, showing more than one side to a character. The possibility of them being both fully bad and fully some one to which you can relate, it shows really well thought out plot and development."
5386,continuation,"Dr. Who is somehow both a true hero, and an anti hero. There are few characters on tv that should be thought of the hero, but seem to end up being despised as much or more than the villain."
5387,elaboration,"I think shows that focus so much on one character as sort of their go to good guy, get lost when viewers tend to like another character better."
5388,joking_sarcastic,"Well all root for Lucifer on supernatural. How weird does that sound? Go Devil, go!"
5389,change,"The way they integrate so many worlds in that show, even with earth being sort of central, they do a good job of it. Making me care for aliens and things I do not even understand."
5390,continuation,"He is such a big personality, he has a real presence, something to appeal to everyone."
5391,elaboration,"He really is big, but some how down to earth too? You know, like I feel I could see him, if he were real and he would be chill, just like any other down to earth person."
5392,joking_sarcastic,I am pretty sure he only comes down to earth to save us. He is literally beyond the clouds most the time.
5393,change,"There is an aspect of despair too, I guess. The sadness every time he has to leave a companion behind, so they can have a life. Makes it seem more real."
5394,continuation,"He really is one of those guys, architypes, that can always be there for you."
5395,elaboration,"He never really leaves any one behind. I like that, the sense of hope that there is some being out there that will always save us."
5396,joking_sarcastic,I am pretty sure Rose and hand doctor would disagree. That is... if they were not stuck in another world alone for all eternity.
5397,change,Do you think things will get better or worse once Moffat hands over the show to someone else?
5398,continuation,"Still, none of the old ones can hold a candle to the new version. David Tennant will always be my favorite."
5399,elaboration,"Yeah, Tom Baker has a lot of charisma on the screen, his humor and joy is kind of infectious."
5400,joking_sarcastic,"I remember a lot of things, too: the cardboard sets, the cheesy special effects..."
5401,change,"I didn't really care for her spin-off show, it was too kiddie focused. I did like Torchwood, though. Did you watch that?"
5402,continuation,"I never saw her episodes of the old shows, but I thought it was fun that they brought her back for the new series. Even if it doesn't really matter to me I like that they care enough about their die-hard fans to do things like that."
5403,elaboration,"I only saw her for a few episodes with Tom Baker, but I liked her feisty attitude."
5404,joking_sarcastic,"I think a lot of the side characters on the old show were pretty formulaic, too. I can't tell one from the others."
5405,change,"The way the show uses time travel is very clever. Even at times when it seems too confusing, they somehow manage to make it make sense."
5406,continuation,"The old ones are classic, if a bit overly cheesy at times. The whole show has progressed so well into a mature series, but still funny and for the most part kid friendly."
5407,elaboration,"I like that Dr. Who can somehow always stay relevant, to different people, times and places. There is something in it that anyone and everyone can relate to."
5408,joking_sarcastic,"Duh, because time travel is real! They have time to find out about people."
5409,change,"I like shows that keep the American spirit, of finding new lands, exploring, never settling."
5410,continuation,"The whole series is really out there, and puts on a whole show and feel out future and space."
5411,elaboration,"The way the show always felt like it was still young, like even in the future we would still be these starry eyed explorers."
5412,joking_sarcastic,"Literally, they actually would be explorers with actual stars in their eyesight."
5413,change,"You want to talk about dirty movies, let's look at Zach Galifinakas. He can't ever be in a clean role."
5414,continuation,"I know what you mean, the first that comes to mind is Anchorman."
5415,elaboration,"I agree, his moves seem a little dirtier than most, but that's what some people think is funny. I personally like Anchorman, and Old School."
5416,joking_sarcastic,"""What do you mean?"" ""You have a massive..."" haha"
5417,change,"When was the last time anyone ate candy corn, it's so terrible."
5418,continuation,"Yea I'd love that! We could have toys out, legos and fake snow!"
5419,elaboration,"We could set up a fake toy store and trash the place, or have our own montage of setting up the decorations!"
5420,joking_sarcastic,"If we have the four main food groups, they have to be served with or on a plate of Spaghetti!"
5421,prompt,Let's talk about politics

5426,prompt,Let's talk about politics
5427,General,Many of the politicians who were so critical of Trump during the campaign quickly fell in line when he won the election because they wanted to get a Cabinet job or at least stay on his good side
5428,Question,You know how you can tell when a politician is lying? When his lips are moving.
5429,Similar,politics makes my blood pressure go up when I watch the news
5430,Specific,Politicians only care about one thing - getting re-elected or moving to a higher office because they have such cushy jobs at taxpayer expense.
5431,prompt,Let's talk about politics
5432,General,I began to dislike talking politics with friends as early as Grade 7.
5433,Question,"I can quickly find out if I like someone or not based on their political views, haha..."
5434,Similar,"Yikes-- maybe politics in history, instead of current politics."
5435,Specific,I find that I don't truly enjoy discussing or debating opposing political views with others.
5436,prompt,Let's talk about fashion
5437,General,"I loved to follow trends when I was a teenager.  I paid $150 for a super fashionable outfit, with flare leg jeans and a funky printed shirt; when I came home from college, my mom pulled an almost identical outfit out from her trunk of clothes she wore."
5438,Question,Fashonista hipsters are just people in skinny jeans drinking Pabst beer.
5439,Similar,"I think fashion trends are set by the industry, not as a creative outlet, but as a way to earn a profit from the masses."
5440,Specific,A lot of the clothes and accessories we buy are made by children in sweatshops.
5441,prompt,Let's talk about fashion
5442,General,The runway shows in new york and milan and paris are merely excuses for the designers to market their goods so they can make millions
5443,Question,You know the old joke about fashion.  If you don't like this season's designs wait about 15 minutes and you will have something new to waste your money on
5444,Similar,I don't pay much attention to the latest fashion trends
5445,Specific,Fashion keeps changing because the designers need to convince people they need to buy the latest looks so the designers can keep charging outrageous amounts for them
5446,prompt,Let's talk about fashion
5447,General,I remember when I was in middle school and fuzzy 'carpet' shirts were in style. No one would be caught dead in those today.
5448,Question,Anything's better than wearing a potato sack!
5449,Similar,I think that high fashion is impractical. I prefer clothes that are more wearable and comfy over what looks artistic.
5450,Specific,Fashions change very often.
5451,prompt,Let's talk about entertainment
5452,General,every time there is a new movie to be promoted the stars make the rounds on these shows.  I saw Goldie Hawn and Amy Schumer on one of these shows last nights and you could tell they were doing  this marketing only because it was in their deal when they sign on to do the move.
5453,Question,"The movie they were promoting is supposed to be a comedy but the clips they showed looked silly and the ""stars"" seemed embarrassed like they only did the movie for the money"
5454,Similar,there is too much entertainment news on tv nowadays
5455,Specific,the entertainment news programs are like p.r. machines for hollywood
5456,prompt,Let's talk about entertainment
5457,General,Most of my first dates have been to the movie theater. It's a great conversation starter and gives you something to discuss for a while afterwards.
5458,Question,"When I was eight months pregnant, we went to the movies and I had to waddle up and down the stairs to the restroom at least five times."
5459,Similar,"I love all types of entertainment, but my favorite is going to the movies."

5466,prompt,Let's talk about technology
5467,General,"One of the biggest events in history, the D-Day invasion, was planned in secret by Gen. Eisenhower and his staff using only file cards and it saved the world from the Nazis"
5468,Question,If computers had been in charge of the D-Day invasion the Nazis would have hacked them and known about it in advance and we might all be speaking German right now.
5469,Similar,Technology is important but it seems like it runs our lives nowadays rather than the other way around
5470,Specific,The world got along fine before the internet and smart phones and computers and there was less stress in the workplace because technology has replaced many jobs
5471,prompt,Let's talk about technology
5472,General,I have so many gadgets that we have a special table in our house for all our devices. We have a charger station set up in our kitchen.

5474,Similar,I like technology but I think people spend too much time on their phones these days.

5476,prompt,Let's talk about technology
5477,General,"I always dreamed of having the handheld computer Captain Picard was always using on Star Trek. Now with an iPad, I feel like I do."
5478,Question,The technology of my parents TV is so advanced they call me regularly to help them use it.
5479,Similar,"I love technology, I rely on it for so many things. Although, sometimes I wonder if it's detrimental to be so reliant on it."
5480,Specific,"Robotics is advancing so quickly, I wonder how human like they will become."
5481,prompt,Let's talk about sports
5482,General,I remember when I was young Sunday mornings sitting in front of my old big box television watching Tony Gwynn playing for the Padres.
5483,Question,The only guy who can date a supermodel and keep winning at sports is Tom Brady.
5484,Similar,"Baseball is all over the place, it has no rhyme to it, I never know which team is going to win these days."
5485,Specific,I guess if a sport is on at night or in the morning I am willing to watch.
5486,prompt,Let's talk about sports
5487,General,Why pay to sit in the hot sun in an uncomfortable seat surrounded by a bunch of people when you can sit in an air conditioned room for free??
5488,Question,Millions of dollars a year to play a sport a few months out of the year and be adored all year long.. yeeeah tough life.
5489,Similar,"If the Super Bowl was being played in our backyard, I still wouldn't watch."
5490,Specific,"I like sports movies, especially when they're comedies."
5491,prompt,Let's talk about sports
5492,General,"I go to Fenway Park with my family every summer, so baseball is probably my favorite of all sports."
5493,Question,I heard that game sucked! Someone must have deflated all of the balls again.
5494,Similar,"Too many sports are fake these days, people just do it for the money and it's not as fun to watch anymore."
5495,Specific,"I'm not big on watching sports, but I really like following the individual athletes on social media."
5496,change,"Yeah, no kidding. There was this news about them building a new rec center downtown."
5497,joking_sarcastic,"What, you don't enjoy hearing every day about something new Trump did to ruin the country?"
5498,More_detail,I know! It seems like you can't escape it. I haven't heard a thing on the radio that wasn't about politics in days.
5499,Sympathetic,Me too! I feel like we just keep saying the same things and nothing changes.
5500,change,That's interesting.  Do you think he was political or just trying to be funny?
5501,joking_sarcastic,I love the play on words.  Was he cutting the cheese?  Just kidding.  I think sloganed shirts can be a riot.
5502,More_detail,I think it's so interesting how they took that slogan from the Reagan era.
5503,Sympathetic,That shirt slogan works really well in a deli.  I wonder what other pun-filled slogans there are for other jobs.
5504,change,"Eh, that's all just scandal stuff. Have you seen the new Republican tax proposal?"
5505,joking_sarcastic,"Well, all I know is that it takes a lot of heat off of me. Do svidaniya, Comey!"
5506,More_detail,It's a crazy situation. Firing the director of the FBI would be big news even if there wasn't an ongoing investigation.
5507,Sympathetic,I love how so many positions flipped. Some people who were saying last week that Comey was terrible and improperly inserted himself into the election are now freaking out that he got ousted. Do they hate the guy or love him?
5508,change,"Speaking of Russia, have you heard about their efforts to regulate bitcoin? It's been in the news lately."
5509,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, I'm SURE that writing to state representatives does SO MUCH, it's not like Russia FIXED the election or anything."
5510,More_detail,"Yes, it really does seem that given the surprising election results in 2016, more people are becoming actively involved in politics."
5511,Sympathetic,"I agree. I myself have been volunteering more for Democratic organizations, and have seen a drastic increase in how many are writing letters to their state representatives."
5512,change,"i do not vote as to me its such a waste of time but this year i would cos i need to also have a say on who governs me, have you registered yet?"
5513,joking_sarcastic,"they be like ""please vote for me"" and once their in they  like "" well thanks i would see you guys in the next four years for a third term"""
5514,More_detail,"they perform really poorly once they are re elected especially if its going to be their last term in office,they are of the idea that after all i am not re contesting so who cares."
5515,Sympathetic,"it is the masses who get fooled by their sweet talk and later complain and protest for change i do feel pity for, using their tax deduction to pay someone who's just not doing their job."
5516,change,I think a lot of politicians use the George Costanza method: It's not a lie if you believe it.
5517,joking_sarcastic,"They know that people have figured that out, that's why they're moving to twitter now."
5518,More_detail,"Yeah, but what are you going to to do, if everybody thinks you need to be a slick liar to be a politician then honest people won't even bother with it."
5519,Sympathetic,"Yeah, they all do it. The trick now, though, is how do you tell when the news reporters are lying?"
5520,change,"I've been trying to get more of my news on the internet, I feel like it's less produced and manipulative when I can consume things at my own pace."
5521,joking_sarcastic,The pharmaceutical companies probably pay them to make sure they get that result.
5522,More_detail,"I used to be able to watch normal news without too much trouble, but it seems like now every story involves somebody being outraged about something somebody else did."
5523,Sympathetic,"Me too, but when I don't keep up to date it stresses me out to, I feel like I'm not being a good citizen."
5524,change,Right?  What about how Kelly Ann Conway deals with the media when talking about Trump?
5525,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, they didn't want to be bumped off the way the Russians deal with their critics."
5526,More_detail,You're right.  They seemed terrified of what he would do to them with all his late night tweets.
5527,Sympathetic,I agree.  They really did just fall in line when he won the election.  And many of them were able to get Cabinet jobs or special favors.
5528,change,I get a little worried that we're all isolating ourselves in social media silos. Sometimes it seems like people with different views don't even live in the same world.
5529,joking_sarcastic,"But discussing politics is where you can get off the sickest burns, how could you pass up that opportunity?"
5530,More_detail,"Yes, it's very frustrating. It never seems to lead to anything but acrimony and recrimination."
5531,Sympathetic,"It's true, I don't enjoy it either. But I feel an obligation as a citizen, we all need to live together, you know?"
5532,change,"If you think about it, in such a large country there statistically have to be some pretty terrible people who agree with your politics, no matter what you believe."
5533,joking_sarcastic,"Not me, it usually takes about three or four two-year terms in the House and then another six years in the Senate before I figure it out."
5534,More_detail,"What people care about politically tells you a lot about who they are as people, doesn't it make a lot of sense that it's a good way to figure out who you'd want to be friends with?"
5535,Sympathetic,"I'm always amazed when I hear about romantic couples who are polar opposites politically, I can never figure out how something like that happens."
5536,change,"When I think about history I don't really think about politics much, I tend to think about the wars. I saw this really cool show about D-Day the other day."
5537,joking_sarcastic,"Hey, if everybody thought that way then only freaks and weirdos would deal with politics. Wait, maybe that explains some things."
5538,More_detail,"We say that politics is pretty bitter nowadays, but have you ever looked at the kinds of things people said about each other in the post-Revolutionary era?"
5539,Sympathetic,What do you think it is about politics that makes it so stressful to talk about?
5540,change,Did you go to school with very politically minded students?  7th graders nowadays seem so much more aware of the world.
5541,joking_sarcastic,7th grade can be rife with political turmoil.  Especially when it comes to student council elections!
5542,More_detail,Talking politics can be a sure way to ruin a friendship or get into a heated argument very quickly.
5543,Sympathetic,You must have been a very intelligent 7th grader.  Some people don't learn to be discreet about politics until much later in life.
5544,change,"I wonder if their parents know where their children are, or if the even care."
5545,joking_sarcastic,Perhaps we need to start a child labor union making sure they at least get a recess.
5546,More_detail,The children have to work long hours with little to no pay in horrible conditions.
5547,Sympathetic,The children barely have enough to eat and I don't think they get to sleep but 3 hours a night.
5548,change,So I'm not really into fashionista hipsters much either.  But what about that new kink of cargo shorts that Target is carrying?  Do you like those?
5549,joking_sarcastic,What if the fashionista hipster was drinking Coors beer.  Would that make a difference?
5550,More_detail,Do you think that about all fashionista hipsters?  Male and female?
5551,Sympathetic,Wow.  Sounds like you don't have a very high regard for people who are really into fashion.
5552,change,nan
5553,joking_sarcastic,nan
5554,More_detail,nan
5555,Sympathetic,nan
5556,change,And where are those clothes now?  I hope you are saving them for your children in the future.  They'll love it.
5557,joking_sarcastic,"I don't know if it was a good look then, or a good look now.  But you could pull it off."
5558,More_detail,"I love how fashion cycles repeat.  It seems as if every 20 or 30 years, we're wearing what our parents wore."
5559,Sympathetic,Your mom sounds super stylish.  And you are following in her foot steps.  You can go shopping in her closet.
5560,change,"What I really love about fashion is the underground designers.  Those actual artists that make high quality, beautiful items, that a normal person could afford.  You can usually find gorgeous outfits at the smaller boutiques.  I really prefer to shop at those quaint local establishments."
5561,joking_sarcastic,"Although, how on EARTH would all of these C list, reality show ""models"" possibly be able to make a living if they didn't have designers fawning all over them to ""oh please wear this $599 rag skirt""?!?!  It's truly a disgusting age that we live in these days!"
5562,More_detail,"Oh, I completely know exactly what you're talking about.  All of this ""evolving"" of fashion at ridiculous prices is beyond annoying. The designers are always shoving some B lister down our throats in hopes that we'll feel bad enough about ourselves that we'll just go pay anything to ""look"" better."
5563,Sympathetic,"I just feel so bad for some of these people out there that are made to feel bad about themselves simply because they can't afford the newest Coach hobo bag.  Or that some poor people actually will spend their entire tax refund checks on the newest fashion & most expensive shoes instead of taking care of needs.  No one in the fashion industry, especially the designers, even cares.  Otherwise their clothing wouldn't cost $200 for a pair of jeans."
5564,change,I like to shop in a way that gets me in and out of stores. I usually do not like to stay long.
5565,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I prefer to wait about 20 minutes usually. I feel like thats when the deals come out."
5566,More_detail,"Yea, seems like these companies put out something new just about every other day. We find ways to buy the stuff too so I can't really complain."
5567,Sympathetic,"Yea, people will really buy anything these days. It's a shame that people are so willing to waste so much money."
5568,change,"Well, a trend I am following is a lot of the garment industry moving overseas. It makes me uncomfortable thinking about so many people working in sweatshops."
5569,joking_sarcastic,"I don't follow the trends, the trends follow me. I'm basically a style icon."
5570,More_detail,"I didn't use to, but I got sucked into it when I started watching Project Runway."
5571,Sympathetic,"I don't really follow the trends, I like the classics. If something looks good it looks good, it doesn't matter what some magazine says."
5572,change,"That may be the motivation, but regardless of why they do it it's amazing to see the end result of such talent and artistry."
5573,joking_sarcastic,"Wait a minute, are you saying that all these years I've been donating money to fashion shows I shouldn't have been taking the charitable deduction on my taxes?"
5574,More_detail,"That's true, but they don't pretend to be anything else, they're just showing off their goods like anyone else."
5575,Sympathetic,"It's true that it's a marketing event, but I'm not sure it's that straightforward. Wouldn't they show off more practical garments that people would actually buy if that's really all that was going on?"
5576,change,"I know, but there are somethings that I would consider to be timeless.  Like certain brands, watches, jewelry and the simple T shirt and jeans."
5577,joking_sarcastic,Unfortunately my wallet doesn't allow me to keep up with all the changes.  I guess I'm out of style.
5578,More_detail,"Yes, they do.  I think designers are trying to get people to buy whole new wardrobes every season."
5579,Sympathetic,"They do change very often.  It can be hard to keep up, both with the time and financial investment it takes."
5580,change,"People dress so sloppily these days, you may not notice a difference.  I think some people don't look in the mirror before heading out."
5581,joking_sarcastic,I think that is where some of the designers get their ideas!  They go into grocery stores and pick up lumps of vegetables to see how they will look on the average person.
5582,More_detail,"It's interesting that back in the day, people used to wear food sacks as clothing.  Some manufacturers even made labels peel off so that people could use the sack fabric for clothing."
5583,Sympathetic,"Yes, potato sacks don't look good on anyone.  Clothing is clothing, but it is not expensive or difficult to make a little extra effort to look good."
5584,change,You know it. Don't you wish that your job was more of a casual office? I hate formal wear as well.
5585,joking_sarcastic,I'm sure the ladies at the grocery store absolutely love the sweatpants and stained white t shirt combo too.
5586,More_detail,I really like just throwing on a pair of sweatpants and a t shirt and hanging around the house. It's cheaper and it feels good.
5587,Sympathetic,"Oh man, I completely agree. I even wear it outside of the house. All I care about is comfort, I'm not spending 50 dollars for  a t shirt."
5588,change,What about high school? What was the trend then and what did you think about it?
5589,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, it's a good thing today that people don't wear things that they're going to regret in the future."
5590,More_detail,Two thirds of the school wore them everyday and it was a trend but like every other trend it died.
5591,Sympathetic,Those shirts bring back good memories when we were kids and maybe someone would wear them today to feel good.
5592,change,I wanna go to Holllywood someday. I would love to see Disneyland. That seems like a fun place.
5593,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, they sure promote the wrong information and for that I thank them. They are great at them."
5594,More_detail,"Yea, they are amazing at promoting Hollywood. I am impressed by the way that they promote the stars."
5595,Sympathetic,"Yea, I agree. They are pretty cool. They really do a great job of making us privy to all of the latest news."
5596,change,How about we go to the movies next weekend?
5597,joking_sarcastic,I could do a better job at making a movie.
5598,More_detail,"I know, there are  some movies that are like that. I think they make them just thinking some suckers will want to go see them."
5599,Sympathetic,On the other hand maybe they just take the jobs during the slow times.
5600,change,Do you still have that 60inch TV? I used to enjoy watching movies on HD on that TV.
5601,joking_sarcastic,Yeah right there is not enough on television now with all this Trump news.
5602,More_detail,I agree there are not enough real news sources like Fox or CNN on TV to watch.
5603,Sympathetic,"Yeah but there is a reason, it is fun to watch and read about. Who does not love it?"
5604,change,"Never! Speaking of, did you hear of any Netflix originals coming out recently?"
5605,joking_sarcastic,Of course! No actor or actress would EVER take a part in a bad movie just for the money! That's preposterous!
5606,More_detail,"Yeah, every time I flip on late night TV they have some actor or actress peddling their new movie. What's worse is that it's always followed by the same movie commercial once they go on break."
5607,Sympathetic,"Tell me about it, I was watching Conan last night and half of the cast of Wonder Woman was on. I'm sure it's a good movie but still..."
5608,change,Do you have plans for this weekend.  I was thinking about checking out the Wonder Woman movie and wondering if you'd like to join me.
5609,joking_sarcastic,That's true - otherwise you might get typecast into certain roles and people only think of you one way which is fine until the character is obsolete or gets killed off.
5610,More_detail,I know what you mean.  Robert DiNiro can do everything from serious drama to light comedy because he is so versatile.
5611,Sympathetic,To be successful as an actor and get lots of roles you have to be versatile especially as you get older.
5612,change,The Oscars are too political for me but I enjoy a good movie as the next person.  Hollywood is an industry and big business so they are out to make money which can be seen as selling out but business is business.
5613,joking_sarcastic,Yeah but they they go ahead and give the Oscar to Moonlight so go figure ...
5614,More_detail,Lately it seems like most of the movies are either too violent or scary for my tastes.
5615,Sympathetic,I know what you mean.  But every once in a while they come out with something great like La La Land and it restores my faith in Holywood.
5616,change,"I haven't been out to the theater in a while, but I watch a lot of TV. There was a new show just came out on Netflix I think you would like."
5617,joking_sarcastic,"So, you like spending fifteen dollars to do exactly what you could do at home, only with perfect strangers who won't shut the hell up?"
5618,More_detail,I love the old theater near downtown. The seats aren't nearly as comfortable but the people there are so nice.
5619,Sympathetic,I go to the dollar theater near the mall sometimes. It's just as nice as Cinemark if you don't mind waiting a bit for new movies.
5620,change,"That's true, but sometimes having to be quiet during the movie can be awkward on a first date.  I kind of like to go out to dinner on a first date and have a conversation then.  If your date can carry on a conversation over dinner, then the stars may just align."
5621,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, and most of my last dates have been to a movie theater, too.  Usually, my date is so boring, I just end up falling asleep during the movie.  At least, I get to catch up on my nap time."
5622,More_detail,"Oh, yeah, and it is really great if your date loves movies as much as you do.  I really love movies and love to talk about them.  The best thing ever would be if my date was a real movie freak like me."
5623,Sympathetic,"That's really true and it is an easy way to find out if you and your date have anything in common.  To be honest, if you can't agree on the types of movies you like then things may be doomed from the start."
5624,change,Have you seen any good concerts lately?
5625,joking_sarcastic,Maybe they can sneak in.
5626,More_detail,Ticket prices are crazy. I paid 400 to see TOm Petty
5627,Sympathetic,I feel bad for those who want to go but can't afford it.
5628,change,Yeah it reminds me of that green day concert I went to last year where the audience was unenthusiastic.
5629,joking_sarcastic,Yeah I'm pretty sure the audience was on the verge of falling asleep standing up!
5630,More_detail,The audience seemed to be very low energy and didn't seem to be as into the music as they should have been.
5631,Sympathetic,"Yeah, it really could have been better. I think the band needs to start with a more exciting song."
5632,change,"i seldom attend live concerts,i had prefer see a live jazz performance, do you have any interest in  jazz music?"
5633,joking_sarcastic,"it comes with all the live parkage as well,live pick pocketing,seeing your favorite artist get too high they don't remember the next line to their own song."
5634,More_detail,"me too,live concert are a way to get to see your favorite stars in person,beside it gives a different feel from just listening on cd or via earpiece"
5635,Sympathetic,these days with artist only miming to their track on cd when they ought to perform with a live band i see no difference just playing the cd at home if that is what they would still slot in and just jump around the stage miming to it.
5636,change,My first concert was the same year that I had to move away from Boston. Not a good time.
5637,joking_sarcastic,"Wow. That was some time ago, pretty sure they don't look the way they did back then!"
5638,More_detail,"There were lots of music acts out at the time, but I preferred them over the rest."
5639,Sympathetic,I think those are both great acts and would be wonderful as a first concert.
5640,change,Have you seen the latest Apple computer?
5641,joking_sarcastic,"But computers could replace you and everyone , we wont need humans"
5642,More_detail,you are correct. I remember when I was growing up there was  no such thing as  computers and we got a long fine. There were plenty of jobs.
5643,Sympathetic,"Yes, there were. Sad how things change"
5644,change,"Speaking of which, what is your opinion on Japanese robots helping seniors in retirement homes?"
5645,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, why don't we just build HUMAN bots that cry a lot for the HUMANITY, that will help us get things done."
5646,More_detail,"Yes, imagining the Nazis with their hands on the technology we have today is quite scary. If they could do as much damage as they did with their limited technology, just think of how much more they could do with the technology of today."
5647,Sympathetic,The D-Day invasion scenario brings up an interesting point. I think it is important to think about the effects that technology has on humanity rather than just inventing technology for the sake for it.
5648,change,"the movie ""Robot"" by Will Smith kinda summarizes what we're up against in the future,have you seen it, or don't you watch science fiction movies?"
5649,joking_sarcastic,"i am yet to see a technology that would help me do my homework,read for my exams and go write them and come out with good grades, then it can run myself for all i care lol"
5650,More_detail,well i think that's the purpose anyway to make live as easy as possible and allow technology do the hassles.
5651,Sympathetic,aside that it has seen many lose their jobs to technology and increasing the unemployment rate.
5652,change,"If we had to launch a D-Day invasion today, do you think we could pull it off? Or have we overcomplicated everything too much?"
5653,joking_sarcastic,"I know, file cards are amazing. Think about what Alexander the Great might have accomplished if he had access to them."
5654,More_detail,"That's true, but they probably would have used the atom bomb if they had had it in time, and that's one of the most scientifically complex devices ever created by humans."
5655,Sympathetic,"At the end of the day I suppose that technology is really only a tool, the important thing is the people using it, and maybe how they use it."
5656,change,"Other things have changed rapidly, too, like social norms and culture. I wonder how we decide what gets classified as technology and what doesn't."
5657,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, it's probably due for a change where it will start getting more primitive for a while."
5658,More_detail,"That's true, things keep getting faster. Have you heard about the concept of the singularity, where technological change will reach a point after which the world will be so different that it will be unrecognizable?"
5659,Sympathetic,"In a lot of ways it has, I never dreamed I'd have a house without a landline phone. But some things stay the same: No flying cars, no jet packs, no vacations on the moon."
5660,change,"Speaking of baby boomers, I need to get a birthday present for my aunt. Do you think she would like one of the Amazon fire tablets?"
5661,joking_sarcastic,Yeah - when they were growing up the closest thing to a computer was an adding machine.
5662,More_detail,I have the same problem with texts from my Dad.  I guess the baby boomer generation is not too tech savvy
5663,Sympathetic,That's true for some of them but you have to remember that they grew up without computers or smart phones
5664,change,Do you think that's going to start changing once AIs start getting smart enough that people can start working less?
5665,joking_sarcastic,Back in caveman days people probably complained about people spending all their time sharpening spears rather than being present with the people around them.
5666,More_detail,"Yes, but at least that way they're communicating with humans, not just staring at a TV."
5667,Sympathetic,"Yeah, it's frustrating to be trying to spend time with someone but their mind isn't there with you, it's one whatever their phone is showing them."
5668,change,"They say that brain chips are the future. I've read that scientists are going to develop brain chips to help ""install"" foreign languages into your brain."
5669,joking_sarcastic,"Who knows, maybe a company is working on implantable brain chips that'll allow you to wirelessly recharge your phones. I sure hope they'd have a life-long warranty on that."
5670,More_detail,I feel you on that one. I have so many outlets and cords at my work desk that I trip at least once a day before I drink my morning coffee!
5671,Sympathetic,"Being too plugged in can really feel confining in a way. I've experienced the ""charger station"" and the ""too many cords"" program as well. There needs to be a simpler way to charge your devices."
5672,change,"Do you think humans will ever become more like robots?  The technology is being developed for humans to become stronger, faster, and smarter."
5673,joking_sarcastic,"Actually, I am a robot programmed to come and destroy you.  Just kidding.  But if I was a robot, wouldn't that be terrifying?"
5674,More_detail,"I saw a video of a robot that acted so human it was difficult to see the difference.  They had human features, voices, and movements."
5675,Sympathetic,It's amazing how quickly robotics is advancing.  It won't be long until they will be confused with humans.
5676,change,Are your parents doing well?  What types of shows do they like to watch?  That's cute that they call you for help.
5677,joking_sarcastic,"They'll start calling you about their phones, tablets and microwaves next!  I miss the good old days."
5678,More_detail,These TVs are so smart and have so many features.  Picture-in-picture used to be the most exciting thing one could do with a TV in the past.
5679,Sympathetic,That's so nice that you help your parents out with their TV.  I'm sure they appreciate it.
5680,change,Have you ever watched those shows where people have to survive in the wilderness without any modern technology?
5681,joking_sarcastic,"I certainly hope not, I'm scheduled to be upgraded to full cyborg status next Tuesday."
5682,More_detail,"If you think about it, using fire to cook, or wearing clothes, or building shelter are all forms of technology. Relying on it is part of what makes us human."
5683,Sympathetic,"Yeah, wouldn't it be scary if there was an electromagnetic pulse that fried all of our electronics?"
5684,change,"A few years ago people used to talk about how the communicators on old Trek had similarities to flip phones, but nobody uses flip phones anymore."
5685,joking_sarcastic,"Do you ever find yourself asking Siri to make you some tea, Earl Gray, hot?"
5686,More_detail,"Yeah, it's a cool interface. I just wish I had more I could do with it. I need some kind of bluetooth tricorder, so I can go out and take some readings or something."
5687,Sympathetic,It is pretty cool that the stuff we have now is stuff that used to be science fiction. We're living in the future!
5688,change,What kind of food do you serve when you plan a tail gate party? We usually just serve finger foods and beer.
5689,joking_sarcastic,Baseball is the only game where a man can slap another man on the butt and get paid for it.
5690,More_detail,At my house the Superbowl is our favorite event of the year. We plan a Superbowl party for our family members and friends who want to watch with us and we have a blast.
5691,Sympathetic,I think it's so sad that some people can't go to games with their families because they are working so much. There is a lot of bonding that goes on between parents and children when they share their love for sports.
5692,change,"I don't know, I guess Tom Brady's doing all right. But I'm a lot more interested in the Olympics."
5693,joking_sarcastic,"Hey, I remember David Bowie winning the world cup after marrying that supermodel. Was that David Bowie? I might have just dreamed it."
5694,More_detail,"Yeah, I remember his last game they kept cutting to show her watching in the stands."
5695,Sympathetic,"Ha, it seems like the more we hear about who some player is dating the worse he plays."
5696,change,"I also never know what the hell is going on with the weather, it is almost as out of control as baseball."
5697,joking_sarcastic,"It is almost like I know nothing about baseball or sports! I mean, I try to keep my eye on the ball but I just lose it every time."
5698,More_detail,"Take the Red Sox, for example. They are so unreliable these days despite having the same lineup each night."
5699,Sympathetic,"Every time I watch a game, it never turns out how I expect it to, even when I know the team's lineup!"
5700,change,What other sports do you watch?
5701,joking_sarcastic,Well I dont know about that!
5702,More_detail,"I did not watch baseball back then, I watch it once in a while now"
5703,Sympathetic,"Yes, those were the good old days."
5704,change,"What about family themed sports movies, what are some of your favorites in that genre?"
5705,joking_sarcastic,"Sandler at his peak! Well, before he stopped making comedies and moved on to his recent Oscar Worthy endeavors."
5706,More_detail,"Oh yeah, I agree. Dodgeball, Kingpin, Talladega Nights, those are all classic sports comedy movies!"
5707,Sympathetic,"I love the slapstick part of them too. Also Happy Gilmore, that is probably my favorite."
5708,change,"Those people might get over paid, but what about the kids who just get millions and millions of dollars because they happened to be born into the right family?"
5709,joking_sarcastic,"But it's so HARD having everything given too you, and all you really have to do is PLAY A GAME. I mean those games are LIFE AND DEATH."
5710,More_detail,"Besides the millions of dollars a year to play the sport, don't forget the other millions of dollars and free stuff from getting sponsored by a major company like Nike or Reebok."
5711,Sympathetic,"Those people are getting paid way too much, and being idolized way too hard, for what they do. I'm glad they can run, jump, throw, whatever, but it's not a real job or something that helps the world."
5712,change,Did you see the Budweiser commercial last year?
5713,joking_sarcastic,The commercials are the only good part.
5714,More_detail,"I would not watch either, foot ball is boring."
5715,Sympathetic,"I would not watch the game, but I might watch the commercials."
5716,change,What about watching the games at a sports bar with friends where they have large screen and you can have the best of both worlds?
5717,joking_sarcastic,That may be true but half the time you are so far away from the action in the stadium and people stand up to block your view so you don't seem much except other fans
5718,More_detail,"I know what you mean, and the price of buying a ticket plus parking and snacks is ridiculous"
5719,Sympathetic,"Of course, some sports fans believe the only want to really experience the event is to see it in person"
5720,change,"Some NBA player's have worthwhile social media pages, but I think actor's are more fun to follow. I don't work out much, so I prefer to watch artists perform."
5721,joking_sarcastic,"And by 'individual athletes', do you mean swimsuit models? I LOVE following the women's beach volleyball teams, if you catch my drift."
5722,More_detail,"Many profession athletes are now using their media platforms for social activism, which I think is a great thing.It provides so much more depth to their character than mere celebrity stardom."
5723,Sympathetic,It's a great way to catch the great clips of a player without having to watch the whole game. I love seeing their families and personal lives too.
5724,change,Oh completely. So do you have tickets for next week too? I was thinking about picking up a pair.
5725,joking_sarcastic,Yeah and it's always good to support all of the upstanding Football players that would NEVER dream to have a run in with the law!
5726,More_detail,"Eh, it wasn't so bad. The game wasn't that exciting but tailgating and having a few drinks in the nice weather is always a good time."
5727,Sympathetic,That's true I guess. It's always fun to go to an event like that. Plus nobody grills up a burger like you do at a tailgate.
5728,change,What about college teams? Are there any particular teams you like to watch?
5729,joking_sarcastic,"i know! It's like they get paid millions of dollars to play a game for a few hours a day. I wish I had that kind of job, but i would rather not go home all battered and bruised."
5730,More_detail,"I don't think it is all that bad. I personally love watching my favorite team, and enjoy following just them through the season."
5731,Sympathetic,"I can see that in some of the pro sports out there, but i am always willing to give it a chance for pure enjoyment of the athleticism."
5732,change,"Nothing like going to the ballpark. Outside of Fenway, what's your favorite place to catch a game?"
5733,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, all the time. Of course he was NEVER in a bad mood when the Sox lost, and the beer was ALWAYS reasonably priced."
5734,More_detail,"That's awesome, I went to Fenway a lot with my Dad when I was a kid. It's really cool to catch a game in a park that people have been going to for nearly 100 years."
5735,Sympathetic,"I completely agree, so many legends have played there. Did you go to a lot of games with your Dad."
5736,change,Some people are just flat out better liars than others. Thats  pretty much the way that it goes.
5737,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, well who knows when they are lying. They are reading off of a script anyway."
5738,More_detail,"Yea, thats usually the way to tell though. News reporters are more difficult to gauge."
5739,Sympathetic,"Yea, I agree. They tend be truthful people, but when they are not, its difficult to tell."
5740,change,"I do love the romper trend though, rompers are really cute for summertime, unless they are on men."
5741,joking_sarcastic,I think its funny when you see a group of kids and the boys jeans are tighter than the girls
5742,More_detail,"I do, it just depends on the type of fasion.  I dont prefer skinny jeans on people especially men."
5743,Sympathetic,"I do however feel bad for them that they feel the need to dress that way, and maybe they dont drink pabst beer,"
5744,change,It amazes me that the big beer brands still stay in business when there are so many awesome micro brews available nowadays.
5745,joking_sarcastic,It really depends. If they used to drink Pabst but stopped because it got too popular then they're an alpha-hipster trendsetter.
5746,More_detail,It makes all the difference in the world. How will people know you're hip and cool if you don't conform to what the other hip and cool people are doing?
5747,Sympathetic,It depends on whether they're doing it because they just like it better or because they're consciously bucking the trend.
5748,change,If you think Fox and CNN are real news what networks do you consider to be fake news?
5749,joking_sarcastic,"I totally agree! But besides Fox news, what other networks do you watch for a good laugh?"
5750,More_detail,These days I don't think there is any distinction between news and entertainment. The line is so blurred between news and opinion that it makes it hard to distinguish between the two unless you really know how to research a topic.
5751,Sympathetic,I prefer to get my news from independent outlets but some of the bigger networks are OK too.
5752,change,I prefer to shop and just find whatever I like. I don't look for a specific style.
5753,joking_sarcastic,Why not just wait for 30 minutes. You might find something even better.  Thats usually the way it works.q
5754,More_detail,"Yea, you're a witty one, aren't you? They say more wait time is better. Ya know?"
5755,Sympathetic,"Yea, the longer you wait, the better your chances are of finding something that interests you."
5756,change,"I actually haven't, but I heard that Hulu has some great shows coming out soon."
5757,joking_sarcastic,Any new originals?  Try one every day! I can't keep up with all the new shows being added.
5758,More_detail,I did!  I heard there's a new season of Master of None.  I can't wait to see it.
5759,Sympathetic,Yes! The show 13 Reasons Why is supposed to be good. It's really popular with kids these days.
5760,change,"I agree, but do you think people are not going to spend money on high fashion rather than something else?"
5761,joking_sarcastic,"What waste of money, you know that you enjoy shopping and getting new designer clothes."
5762,More_detail,Yeah but it depends the new Prada line had some great items that were affordable.
5763,Sympathetic,If the fashion makes you feel and look good can you really say it is a waste of money though?
5764,change,I would love to learn how to make some of my own clothes. Do you think that would be hard?
5765,joking_sarcastic,"Darling, do you expect me wear the $3000 chiffon dashiki by LeMerc more then once? It's only designed to be worn on the 45th Thursday of the year of the dog - and only if the planets align. After that, the colors are all wrong."
5766,More_detail,It is pretty ridiculous. I mean it would be one thing if the clothing you bought was actually high quality and meant to last - then I could see spending a decent amount of money on it. But they want you to wear it once and throw it away and buy more!
5767,Sympathetic,"Yeah, those people are just doing what they think they're supposed to do to fit in and seem successful, while it really just beggars them. Did you know there are actually 52 seasons in the fashion industry? One for every week, that's crazy."
5768,change,speaking of catching a sunburn how about we plan some beach time soon ? i'd much rather catch a sun burn there with you and the kids
5769,joking_sarcastic,i never caught anything at the park more than a great sunburn though the memories i carry around in my heart make the sunburns all worth while
5770,More_detail,"that park does have a long time history for sure, but the history i make with my family and the memories are certainly more important to me than that"
5771,Sympathetic,"i'm glad you got to go to fenway with your dad, did you catch any game balls with him there ?"
5772,change,"Lying is a tricky business, but that's one way to get around a polygraph test. I wonder if they really use those things as often as they make us think in the movies."
5773,joking_sarcastic,You're kidding! I thought EVERYONE believed EVERYTHING politicians say these days!
5774,More_detail,Definitely. That's what makes it so hard to argue about politics - everyone thinks they're right!
5775,Sympathetic,"Yeah, especially these days politics has gotten so partisan and out-of-hand. I wish we could trust our governmental officials more."
5776,change,"Whats your favorite sport? Prrsonally, my favorite is baseball, i watch all the games, and my favorite team is the yankees"
5777,joking_sarcastic,"Happy gilmore is so funny, i love the crocodile in it, theres ao many hilarious scenes, i cant get enough of it."
5778,More_detail,"Sports movies are so funny, the comedies are much better than sports dramas like the blind side.  I prefer movies to be funny"
5779,Sympathetic,"I love happy gilmore, adam sandler is really good in that movie.  Ive seen that movie so many times, iys hilarious"
5780,change,That's why I like buying locally made products where you know that they were made using fair practices.
5781,joking_sarcastic,So they get 3 more hours of sleep a night than I do during the school year?
5782,More_detail,"I know we need to buy clothes, but I wish there was another way that didn't involve sweat shop labor."
5783,Sympathetic,I feel terrible for all of the lack of human rights that those poor children experience making clothes.
5784,change,"Thanks, I'll think about it. I'll think about it after my app is loading. Have fun."
5785,joking_sarcastic,"So, if you don't want to go, I'll understand. Will you get x-ray vision installed too ? Christmas time and birthdays would be less interesting."
5786,More_detail,Technology is useful and it is important to take a break from it once and a while. When was the last time we had an outdoors adventure ?
5787,Sympathetic,Do you want to go for a hike later ? I feel that technology has discouraged us from going out much to breathe in the fresh air.
5788,change,Do you think there are some positive benefits to the technological advancements we've made in the past decade?
5789,joking_sarcastic,I think you are right! Soon we will all have to defend ourselves against murderous robots after they turn against us!
5790,More_detail,I did watch that movie with Will Smith and I do agree that technology can have a disproportionate influence over our lives if we allow it too. I think that movie was a bit of a stretch but who knows what we will see in the future.
5791,Sympathetic,The future of technology is a bit scary. The more we depend on it the more vulnerable we are in general.
5792,change,"I am not sure, did you see that new computer that apple came out with though?"
5793,joking_sarcastic,"No way do not pay attention to movies like the Terminator, there wont be robots like humans."
5794,More_detail,Yea I have heard of different brain to computer interface systems that can be portable.
5795,Sympathetic,"No way, robots will never be able to mimic the humans intuition and consciousness."
5796,change,I just like to buy things that seem appealing to me. I don't like  to worry about anything else.
5797,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, everything has to be about profit these days. God forbid somebody do something for the fun of it."
5798,More_detail,"Yea, thats the way it seems most of the time. Everybody gets involved in things like that for a profit."
5799,Sympathetic,"Yea, money definitely rules the world. Weather people want to admit it or not is up to them."
5800,change,I do try not to buy sweat shop made stuff but sometimes you can't tell beforehand.
5801,joking_sarcastic,"Starving is totally better than sewing, right? Everyone just loves to starve."
5802,More_detail,Of course they know. They hire their kids out. It's sad but true. They're all just trying to survive in these poorer countries.
5803,Sympathetic,I feel bad for them but on the other and they'd likely starve if they didn't work. It's so sad.
5804,change,Sometimes taking the wrong role can ruin and actors career. There are many examples of actors that never recover after taking on a bad part.
5805,joking_sarcastic,Some actors never some to be able to bounce back. I wonder how long slow times will last for Nick Cage?
5806,More_detail,Maybe so but either way it makes the movie hard to watch when the actors heart is not really in it.
5807,Sympathetic,That is very possible. I can completely understand why someone would take a less than perfect role just to make ends meet when things are slow.
5808,change,"Players do earn a lot at the major league level, but minor league players barely make as much as substitute teachers."
5809,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, I hear all you need to become a great athlete is a pair of fancy shoes advertised by the pros!"
5810,More_detail,"I know, right? Now Lonzo Ball is even making his own shoes and selling them for $600 a pop! It's wild how much money they make."
5811,Sympathetic,"True, they do make a ton of money, although they do have to endure long periods away from their families and endless training, so I suppose they are at least earning it."
5812,change,"Nevertheless, I help my parents out the best I can. Even I have to look things up along side them. I hope this teaches them one day that they too can google something if they have enough time to do this."
5813,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, as if everyone is a computer science major and has technology implanted into an arm or something."
5814,More_detail,"Due to them not having extra time to research online or take a technology class, they are always assuming I know about the technology."
5815,Sympathetic,"I agree, yet sometimes I have to admit, even I am baffled by some of the technology without taking a course on it or reading extensively about the subject."
5816,change,Not all games have tailgates. Hockey games don't. Different traditions are cool. And the all you can eat seats at baseball games! Amazing.
5817,joking_sarcastic,"Sometimes the tailgate is better than the game itself, especially if you are watching Cleveland football, you know!"
5818,More_detail,"And at least you get some good food and a laugh if the game is good, like you were talking about!"
5819,Sympathetic,"It's nice to see a community behind sports too. People need to bond together around something common, and the sports teams are happy to see people supporting them."
5820,change,When was the last time you went to a game?
5821,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah that is EXACTLY what we need, more bonding time!"
5822,More_detail,Exactly. I think that people just need more time off from work in general. In Europe they get much more time off than we do on average.
5823,Sympathetic,I agree. I remember as a kid how much time we got to spend with our parents watching sports. I miss those days.
5824,change,Do you like bowling?  That is also a fun way for entertainment that i enjoy.  Its so relaxing to me.
5825,joking_sarcastic,"I love when you go to the movie theater and these kids throwing popcorn at old people.  The old people get so mad, its hilarious."
5826,More_detail,"I love going to the movies, because i love the enviroment.  You go to see this movie with a room full of people who have the same movie interests."
5827,Sympathetic,"I do love Netflix though, theres also something great about being able to relax and being able to watch whatever movie and in your own home"
5828,change,How would you feel if we did not have any types of word processing programs?
5829,joking_sarcastic,I am glad that things have advanced in the world of technology. Can you imagine how the person felt that had to write the information on the index cards felt? I am quite sure they had to write thousands of cards.
5830,More_detail,Can you imagine the amount of attention and detail to the information that was placed on each card for Gen. Eisenhower to be successful in saving the world from the  Nazis.
5831,Sympathetic,It might have been a different outcome if some of the cards were lost or destroyed by accident.
5832,change,What would you say was the most popular fashion trend during your high school years and what would you consider the most iconic style?
5833,joking_sarcastic,Scruchnies and body suits are quite the combo. I am unsure if there was anything fashion forward and iconic about my high school years.
5834,More_detail,"Do not get me started on high school fashion. I can only vaguely remember white UNSIGHTLY body suits, overalls and pagers. At the time I thought I looked so awesome. Looking back I looked ridiculous."
5835,Sympathetic,To go along with our super amazing body suits and overalls I remember having to have scrunchies of every color .
5836,change,I think that Donald Trump is doing a really bad job. He clearly doesn't know how to be a politician and doesn't really know what he is doing either.
5837,joking_sarcastic,"Well, its flat out boring. Would you wanna talk about politics when you can talk about entertainment, sports, etc."
5838,More_detail,I think that there are just too many different opinions. Some people feel so strongly about their representative that they refuse to hear others views and this can cause arguments.
5839,Sympathetic,"I just think that everyone needs to talk about it with an open mind, but that can be difficult sometimes. As a result, it is sometimes better to just not talk about it at all."
5840,change,Speaking of the weather have you heard that is going to be like hurricane weather all next week?
5841,joking_sarcastic,Are you kidding? It was freezing that day and I had no idea how you were able to stay tailgating that long in the cold.
5842,More_detail,I agree those margaritas that you made came out great and were so flavorfull. What is the recipe?
5843,Sympathetic,Who doesnt enjoy the nice weather and some drinks among good friends.  It is a good day.
5844,change,"Just kidding. You look great. Speaking of technology, do you read Scientific American? They're got some great articles, and they've changed their writing style so it's really not hard to read and understand at all."
5845,joking_sarcastic,"Besides, you don't really look like a robot. Just maybe you need to take a little nap, and fix your hair and makeup!"
5846,More_detail,"I don't know, unless you're a war robot. Or an assassin robot. Most robots are being designed to help, not to hurt."
5847,Sympathetic,Although there's always the chance that such technology could be abused. That's what scares me the most.
5848,change,"I do like to shop though especially shoes and bags, not just clothes."
5849,joking_sarcastic,Well maybe it's time I learned how to sew and started making my own clothes!
5850,More_detail,"I agree, have you seen the youtube videos of some overseas sweatshops, so scary."
5851,Sympathetic,I try and buy only American made clothing.
5852,change,speaking of other ways home .. how is your car ? did you get the transmission on it repaired ? is it running well again ?
5853,joking_sarcastic,"of course you can always take your popcorn and pop to the ""restroom"" and find another seat and not look back .. as long as you have another way home LOL"
5854,More_detail,"it depends on the movie ... the date might be boring but hell if the movie is good i'm in it for the duration, the popcorn and the pop"
5855,Sympathetic,there is always time after the movie to extract oneself from the company tactfully and go home for that nap
5856,change,"How big do you think they next iphone will be?  They get bigger and bigger, soon people wont even be able to carry them around."
5857,joking_sarcastic,"It is funny though, when you walk into a party and everyone has their face in there phones."
5858,More_detail,"Thats true, but when they are at a social event they still stare at their phones instead of talking to people around them."
5859,Sympathetic,"And then the people without phones or just flip phones feel left out, because they dont have enough money for a smart phone"
5860,change,I hate spending lots of money on clothes. Its so addicting but yet hard to do.
5861,joking_sarcastic,"Just don't worry about being fashionable and instead, wear whatever you want. That will help."
5862,More_detail,"Yea, fashion can be ever changing. What is fashionable one day can very clearly not be fashionable another day."
5863,Sympathetic,"Yea, its important to keep up with both if you are interested in remaining fashionable. They are both everchanging."
5864,change,"Speaking of tech, did you see the news on Apple's new device?  Looks like another winner for them even though they are late to the game on this one."
5865,joking_sarcastic,I was thinking about sending them a bill for my tech services as a joke but they might be offended
5866,More_detail,They are doing okay but having some health issues lately.  It is cute that they ask me for help when for so many years I was the one asking them for help
5867,Sympathetic,I have the same issues with my parents and sometimes have to make sure I am not losing patience when they keep asking me the same tech questions about their phones or computers or tv.
5868,change,Apparently no one can control Trump.  Maybe when Melanie moves into the White House she can grab his phone and break it in half but he'll just get another one.
5869,joking_sarcastic,Can you imagine Reagan sending out stupid tweets or offending our major allies?  Nancy would have never allowed it!
5870,More_detail,Poor Ronald Reagan is probably turning over in his grave at the stuff going on now in Washington.
5871,Sympathetic,I know what you mean.  Trump is not really a Republican and certainly does not conduct himself with class the way that Reagan did.
5872,change,In the end we all need designers to create the styles that we wear. What we do need more of though are designers that create designs for the average you and me who will spend $100 on a dress for a special occasion.
5873,joking_sarcastic,"You know, it would be a shame for a star to show up on the red carpet with something other then the BEST, they would be talked badly about in magazines because they showed up in a $500 dress opposed to a $5000 dress. How dare they?"
5874,More_detail,"It only costs a designer about $400 in material to make a dress that sells for $2,300. The reason that they are able to mark up so much is because people are willing to pay these prices to be wearing the newest look."
5875,Sympathetic,"I understand that designers need to make a living too, and what you are paying for when you buy a name is just that; the name. This is their living and as long as people pay the prices for a name, then you can't fault the designer for making money off the deal."
5876,change,"Have you ever read Isaac Asimov? He talks a lot about topics like humans being replaced by computers, and it's actually really scary."
5877,joking_sarcastic,"Hey, at least we wouldn't have to deal with jerks like my neighbor anymore if computers replaced people and they were programed to be nice."
5878,More_detail,"Computers have already replaced humans in a lot of areas. When I watched the movie ""Hidden Figures"", I learned that before computers, a ""computer"" was a human who did math work. Isn't that crazy!"
5879,Sympathetic,"But we can take a positive outlook too- technology makes our jobs and our lives easier. We may have to retrain, but things will be easier."
5880,change,No I dont watch commercials much but can you believe the Patriots won after Brady being suspended?
5881,joking_sarcastic,Of course! Who doesnt watch the commercials during the Superbowl they are the best.
5882,More_detail,Yeah that commercial had the three frogs and made me laugh so hard when I saw it.
5883,Sympathetic,No I did not but Budweiser usually has great commercials that air during the Super Bowl.
5884,change,No but do you think they are still trying to hack the DNC and other American politicians.
5885,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah right, the Russians always just try to say they are going to do something but really will not."
5886,More_detail,Bitcoin will never be able to be regulated the way it is set up on the block chain.
5887,Sympathetic,"No I have not, what are the different steps that they are trying to do to regulate it?"
5888,change,What is the last designer outfit that you have spent money on and bought for yourself?
5889,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah right it is basically the same fashion lines with some different print and colors, there is no artistry nowadays."
5890,More_detail,Supposedly the last fashion show generated over $4 million in revenue in just one night.
5891,Sympathetic,The talent and artistry is definitely the best in the world I completely agree with that statement.
5892,change,"Speaking of tea, there's a new tea shop that's opening up downtown. It looks pretty nice."
5893,joking_sarcastic,"I tried once, but she said I had no honor and challenged me to a duel to see who had the right to lead the iPad."
5894,More_detail,"Ha ha, no, but that would be awesome if Siri could do it. I guess I'll need to wait until they come out with bluetooth replicators."
5895,Sympathetic,"You know, back in the day I tried Earl Gray tea because of the show, but I didn't like it."
5896,change,Which actor is your favorite?
5897,joking_sarcastic,Yeah he really is MEANT for other roles. He is VERY talented.
5898,More_detail,Yeah I agree. I hate when actors are typecast into certain roles because it limits them.
5899,Sympathetic,Diversification is so important for actors because it gives them much more depth.
5900,change,I just like watching the sports. I don't really care how much they are paid to be honest.
5901,joking_sarcastic,"yea, but I think those people have more issues to take care of. They should have went to school."
5902,More_detail,Sounds like you may not be realizing that these players do have to work really hard and be away from their families a lot.
5903,Sympathetic,"No, I completely understand that, but so do the people that work the overnight shift at mcdonalds."
5904,change,"while we are talking about salad, you know the new salad place that just opened ? 12 tomatoes or something ? the all you can eat salad bar ? want to take a chance on it and go with me ?"
5905,joking_sarcastic,"cauliflower .... bland, lumpy and no color ... that's me in a nutshell, can you just picture the designer holding the head up and saying yep, this is Kelly ...."
5906,More_detail,"i might agree they do that for color palettes, some of those designers do create some wild things, i wouldn't compare many of them to vegetables though."
5907,Sympathetic,"most of my wardrobe color palette could have come from the salad bar, greens and browns drab mousy blend in with the wall kind of colors you know what i mean ?"
5908,change,A third term? Maybe they should be like the President and only be allowed to serve a maximum of two terms.
5909,joking_sarcastic,"Seriously, they act as if they care about their constituents but definitely they care about lobbyists more."
5910,More_detail,Exactly most politicians should not have a term longer than one year exactly because of that reason.
5911,Sympathetic,"Well that is why they call it politics, you have to adjust on some issues in order to stay in office for a while."
5912,change,So which political side are you on?
5913,joking_sarcastic,Oh yeah like the PAST was more brutal than today's politics. Give me a break.
5914,More_detail,"Oh yeah it was totally brutal man. I mean my gosh, we are so tame today in comparison."
5915,Sympathetic,We need to make sure we do not repeat history and there has to be an amount of civilit that both sides need to practice in order for us to be stronger as a nation.
5916,change,What's really overpriced are these meet-and-greets that most artists have.
5917,joking_sarcastic,Especially if the artist is just lip-syncing. There's nothing worse than paying like $500 just to hear the album being played in a large arena with screaming people.
5918,More_detail,"I understand, but we have to realize the work and effort that artists and their team go through to organize the event. I think most concerts are worth every cent."
5919,Sympathetic,Totally agree! Some artists concerts are too overpriced for their dearest fans.
5920,change,I don't even know why I watch late night TV. Last night I got sucked into a three hour infomercial and didn't even realize it. It really rots your brain.
5921,joking_sarcastic,"I really love the honest and sincere moments between the actor and the host though. You know, since it's all unscripted and unstaged and they just met for the first time ever. Just real stuff."
5922,More_detail,Yeah they lay it on pretty thick. It's weird when you think about Hollywood is behind the scenes. Sometimes it's more like a campaign trail than entertainment.
5923,Sympathetic,"Well what's even worse is that is flipping one channel up and they're running the same star on a different talk show, and running a slightly different movie trailer on the commercial break. You know, cause they have different previews set up  for different channels and demographics. It's too much!"
5924,change,Do you like to watch professional sports? If you had to choose who is your favorite team player and why?
5925,joking_sarcastic,I totally think all college teams suck. They need way more practice and sometimes there are way to unorganized.
5926,More_detail,"I actually enjoy watching my home town team play. The Fresno state bulldogs are a great team, I have a close friend Micheal thats the starting running back for them. Plus the games are always filled with lots of excitement and good energy in the air and it's just nice when your hometown comes together for these events."
5927,Sympathetic,Yes I really like watching the Fresno state bulldogs. What about you? Are there any particular college teams you like to watch?
5928,change,"I love going to the movies. I typically like to see comedy movies, but I'll see anything that can hold my attention."
5929,joking_sarcastic,I like a date where the person is hot. You know? That makes all the difference. Good conversation is for the birds!
5930,More_detail,"Yea, I agree. Sometimes you want to go somewhere where you can share a strong intellectual conversation. I think it is important to hold a good conversation on a good date."
5931,Sympathetic,"Yea, I think both are good, but talking a lot can be good. Sometimes you want to find out a lot of information about someone before it gets overwhelming."
5932,change,I don't even like beer. I think that it tastes bitter and I would much rather just drink soda.
5933,joking_sarcastic,"I find them all weird; male or female. Regardless of the gender, they just seem weird to me."
5934,More_detail,"Eh, sometimes they are, but I think theres more to it than just that. They like to keep up with the latest trends."
5935,Sympathetic,"Yea, I think that they enjoy being unique and fashionable. Theres something to be said for trying to create your own style."
5936,change,I love to play and watch sports. They are all fun. I just love the competition.
5937,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, its almost like they get paid millions to play a game that they grew up playing in their backyard."
5938,More_detail,"Yea, its a tough job and there is definitely a business to sports, but that is a lot of money."
5939,Sympathetic,"I don't know. I think that if I had  the opportunity to make that much money playing a game that love, I will take it."
5940,change,"I think company uniforms make clothing choices easier for me, since you don't even have to make the choice."
5941,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, that's what I wear on all my dates! I'm not sure why none of my dates want to see me a second time, though."
5942,More_detail,"Yeah, regular clothes often provide a far greater range of motion, too, so they have more potential uses."
5943,Sympathetic,"I can see how wearing high fashion clothes would be challenging, though, since they're so expensive and high-maintenance."
5944,change,I have seen some of the same actions in Republican organizations. The Republican party really needs people to keep them on track.
5945,joking_sarcastic,Ordinary people lobbying the government are doing a better job than the government itself. Imagine that!
5946,More_detail,"Yes, I think the one good thing about this political climate is that more people are getting involved. They aren't passively sitting around complaining."
5947,Sympathetic,"Getting involved is the only way we can impact the system and make real change. I love seeing people lobbying representatives, some of whom don't really do their jobs."
5948,change,I wonder how long it will be before flying cars replace to cars of today.
5949,joking_sarcastic,Technology is evil! Eventually it will overpower society and we will all end up defending our lives against crazy killer robots.
5950,More_detail,I have no heard of singularity but I totally agree. Technology is snowballing into something really awesome. New tech is being produced so rapidly it is almost like a snowball effect.
5951,Sympathetic,Technology is changing the world for sure. Sometimes the change is so rapid that it is almost unbelievable. Just think back about what we had before the smart phone and social media.
5952,change,"Speaking of those shoes, I need to use them and get going, going to go back to work."
5953,joking_sarcastic,"People would rather get their clothing, it hasn't stopped you from buying those new shoes I see."
5954,More_detail,I've heard the children are often beaten.  I was reading this article the other week and it went over all of this stuff in detail.
5955,Sympathetic,"I don't know about that but it sounds awful, I don't understand how anyone could support that industry."
5956,change,I just like to go to baseball games and enjoy a nice soda. Its fun and relaxing.
5957,joking_sarcastic,Nothing wrong with a 12 dollar beer. Hope it takes just one to do the trick for ya.
5958,More_detail,"Yea, the beer is never reasonably priced at any park now. They are always expensive."
5959,Sympathetic,"Yea, its fun, but going to a baseball game is nowhere near as cheap as it used to be. Thats for sure."
5960,change,"7th graders tend to think they are too cool and by the time they are in 8th grade, whew!"
5961,joking_sarcastic,"Well, 7th graders just know it all, don't they? I don't wanna talk politics."
5962,More_detail,"Yea, I agree. These days, even kindergarteners know more about the world than you would expect."
5963,Sympathetic,"Yea, students seem to be aware of their surroundings these days. Its being emphasized more."
5964,change,I wonder what its like to live in some country without so much reliance on technology.
5965,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, without electronics, we might have to go outside and interact with other people face to face."
5966,More_detail,Yeah I bet all the big countries have secret EMP weapons and one day someone is going to use it.
5967,Sympathetic,I would be terrified. I would feel so lost without electronics. I would feel disconnected from the world
5968,change,I know! And it's relatively easy today. When I look at old photos I can't help but think about all the effort that must have gone into putting together some of those looks.
5969,joking_sarcastic,"Oh I assure you, I can tell the difference. The secret is being able to feel the texture of the burlap."
5970,More_detail,"Even worse, some of them do look in mirrors and are dressing that way intentionally."
5971,Sympathetic,Some really beautiful people do that sort of thing to show that they're amazing no matter how they dress. Of course a lot more people try that than can really pull it off.
5972,change,"I prefer Facebook for keeping up with celebs, my friends, family, everyone."
5973,joking_sarcastic,"We all know politicians lie on Twitter and also make fools of themselves there. Hello, Trump."
5974,More_detail,What does Twitter have to do with it? Someone can still lie on Twitter easily eough if they want to.
5975,Sympathetic,I personally don't use Twitter as much. There seems to be less interaction among my peers on there.
5976,change,Speaking of reading have you read the new Flash Boys book about Wall Street?
5977,joking_sarcastic,I dont! Entertainment tv is made up and all a lie just to increase ratings and viewership.
5978,More_detail,E news is my favorite show to watch so I can definitely agree with your viewpoint.
5979,Sympathetic,Everyone loves it but sometimes there should be more than just entertainment and gossip news on important news channels.
5980,change,Have you thought about the evolving change with technology? We have to adapt with all the change happening with cell phones and computers. It's like they are making us evolve.
5981,joking_sarcastic,"I feel like they want us looking like ""Space Jam 2021"". They go from baggy jeans to skinny jeans. We are just their baby doll  as they are dressing us up."
5982,More_detail,It's just terrible to see designers putting out some of the most distinctive clothing. I don't know who buys this time or would buy it. I honestly can't afford to pay for a piece of clothing I will only wear once.
5983,Sympathetic,"Sometimes these ""evolving"" fashions may be a good thing because of its indifference to the norm. For example, look at the rip jeans fashion. It has become a thing that almost every young adult wears."
5984,change,"Speaking of showing off the goods, did you see the new Prada line that was released?"
5985,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah right, how are the top fashion labels having shows in Paris and Milan like everyone else?"
5986,More_detail,"Yeah I agree, but they are not like everyone else because they dont have afterparties in Paris and Milan for Levi jeans."
5987,Sympathetic,Showing off their goods should not really be so wastefull with extravagant fashion shows and parties.
5988,change,We should think about the positives that may come from having fresh blood in the government.
5989,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, like it is such a surprise that Trump is appointing people with no experience, say, like... himself?"
5990,More_detail,"And of course, there are some who received jobs who have had absolutely nothing to do with politics, which I find interesting."
5991,Sympathetic,"Yes, it is odd to think how many people there are in politics and hold government positions these days that have absolutely no experience."
5992,change,"It woud be nice if everything could at least have the same plug, makes you miss the old days were the hard search was a three prong outlet."
5993,joking_sarcastic,Just waiting on the day that we get a charging station surgically implanted so we don't have to go searching for the outlet.
5994,More_detail,"I was excited when we got the wireless charging station set up in my office, it makes it easier after a long day."
5995,Sympathetic,"We've spent so much buying more cords, longer cords, and even special cords for keeping outside on the deck."
5996,change,"With technology moving the way it is now, I wonder if one day soon we'll be able to have ""live"" holographic concerts where the band just streams from one location. I'm trying to decide if that would be a tragedy or not."
5997,joking_sarcastic,My favorite part is always when the 300 lb fan decides to crowd surf. That hurts. It's always a weird injury to explain at work the next day.
5998,More_detail,"Rock and metal shows are the best, especially when there's a big floor and you can get close to the stage."
5999,Sympathetic,I agree it's totally different! The music literally vibrates into you and you're surrounded by a bunch of other people who are all there for the exact same reason. It's a connected experience.
6000,change,Have you seen the latest Microsoft computers?
6001,joking_sarcastic,Yeah I totally have the time in my day to go and check that out. I have unlimited time.
6002,More_detail,Oh yeah I have they are amazing in how fast the processor is. I am impressed.
6003,Sympathetic,Yes Apple always has the best computers out there. They have the best performance.
6004,change,How important of a role do you believe the center for any NFL team really is?
6005,joking_sarcastic,Tony Romo should of hung up his cleats a long time ago and he should of become Mr. Hollywood.
6006,More_detail,I always thought of Tony Romo as Mr Hollywood and that he should leave the stars alone during the season for that reason.
6007,Sympathetic,Sometimes I feel bad for a player when they play bad because you wonder what is going on out side of the game.
6008,change,I haven't heard about that. But the other day I saw this cool video online where they had a pair of robot arms like they use in car factories. They were holding katanas and doing a ritualized sword fight.
6009,joking_sarcastic,"Hmmm, are you suggesting that the Axis Powers were playing the long game? Pearl Harbor 2.0 in Sunset Grove?"
6010,More_detail,All I know is that once I'm retired I wouldn't want to have to deal with headaches like stupid malfunctioning robots.
6011,Sympathetic,"My grandmother has trouble figuring out how to get the TV remote control to do what she wants, I hate to think how much trouble she'd have with a robot."
6012,change,speaking of shagging ..... how are you and bobby doing these days ? are you engaged yet ? inquiring minds want to know
6013,joking_sarcastic,a death that came none too soon if you ask me ... being petted like a ... well ... pet ... was fine and well .... until i had things *ahem* to pet ... if you catch my drift
6014,More_detail,"i was lucky to have gone to parochial school and being forced to wear a uniform, i didn't have to wear those shirts to school to fit in and be trendy"
6015,Sympathetic,i felt like a walking shag rug and was afraid to lay on the floor to watch tv for fear people wouldn't see me there and step on me.
6016,change,"Did you see Efron's bod in the latest ""Baywatch"" trailer? Wow, is he taking steroids, or what?"
6017,joking_sarcastic,Thank God Justin Bieber isn't making movies...yet! It was bad enough when Justin Timberlake was in practically everything.
6018,More_detail,"On the other hand, the worst would be a date who likes movies, but not the same kind of movie you do."
6019,Sympathetic,"Like, you like action, she likes rom-coms. She hates sci-fi but wants to see all the movies ever made with Zac Efron in them."
6020,change,"Who knows if we would be able to, I watched a great documentary on the History Channell about Dday the other day."
6021,joking_sarcastic,Absolutely over complicated it only if President Trump were the one leading the charge.
6022,More_detail,It depends on if we would have someone like Eisenhower or Trump leading the charge.
6023,Sympathetic,Who knows thankfully we are not and do not have to plan another D-Day invasion nowadays.
6024,change,What do you think of robotic cars?  I dont know if i trust a car driving for me.
6025,joking_sarcastic,"Theres no way robotics can be better than humans, they dont have a brain to think with"
6026,More_detail,"They are a lot of robotics that can do human jobs now, especially in factories."
6027,Sympathetic,I hope people dont start getting put out of work.  What will happen to their families.
6028,change,What ever happened to Nicholas Cage? At one point is career was going pretty good. Now you never hear about him at all.
6029,joking_sarcastic,I do not agree with you  at all! Actors are not shallow people. There is no way any of them would ever sell their soul for a giant pay check!
6030,More_detail,They don't make movies like the used to. Some of my favorite actors were making quality films a few years back. Now it seems like their careers are made of DVD.
6031,Sympathetic,Seeing some of these actors on the late night shows is really sad. But at the same time it is a part of what they have to do for a living.
6032,change,I like to shop and I think it is fun to find new items. Its good to stay stylish.
6033,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, fashion sense from the 1800's maybe. I don't know how good it is now."
6034,More_detail,"Yea, we'll I admire her fashion sense. I think that she has good fashion sense and seems to be smart."
6035,Sympathetic,"Yea, I enjoy trying to follow in her footsteps. She has great fashion sense."
6036,change,What other types of sports are you interested in? I like figure skating. Some individuals may not consider figure skating a sport.
6037,joking_sarcastic,I always wanted to be a pitcher though. Age had caught up with me so that is just a pipe dream now. I cannot even add that to my bucket list.
6038,More_detail,"Baseball was a sport that I did not like to watch on TV, but I loved to play it when I was young."
6039,Sympathetic,"For some reason, I never really took the time to look at a complete game on TV. I probably would have enjoyed it."
6040,change,"What I really enjoy is shopping for shoes, I have so many pairs."
6041,joking_sarcastic,Well at least we can always find some new clothes to buy?
6042,More_detail,Have you noticed that Lily Pulitzer changes her colors slightly every year.  This way last years clothes won't match this years.
6043,Sympathetic,"I have trouble finding the right fit in jeans, how about you?"
6044,change,I just love being able to watch sports and enjoy the competition.  Its fun to watch!
6045,joking_sarcastic,"yea, why not pick a movie about a completely irrelevent sport like hockey."
6046,More_detail,I really like the movie Miracle. I thought it told a great story of one of America's greatest sports moments.
6047,Sympathetic,"Yea, that hockey  team was really good. I am so glad a movie was made about them."
6048,change,"It really does, did you still want to go to the soccer match tomorrow at 5pm?"
6049,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah right, they just do that for sponsorship dollars and to try and look good. I do not buy it."
6050,More_detail,Absolutely did you just see that Ronaldo donated a new childrens center in Sao Paolo?
6051,Sympathetic,Yeah a lot of celebrities are able to spread awareness a lot easier with social media than previously.
6052,change,I would love to hear about sports as much as I hear about politics these days. That would make me happy.
6053,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, just what I wanna hear. More about Donald Trump and his crazy family."
6054,More_detail,"Yea, sometimes politics are all that you hear. It all depends on the time and what is going on in the world."
6055,Sympathetic,"Yea, well whenever something is going on politically that is big, we are bound to hear about it."
6056,change,Speaking of caveman do you remember those funny gieco caveman commercials?
6057,joking_sarcastic,"Thats funny, I am sure if caveman had phones they would be on them over sharpening their spears though."
6058,More_detail,Yeah but back in caveman days they were trying to survive and needed to sharpen their spears.
6059,Sympathetic,I agree but there should still be time to set aside from our electronics and on ourselves.
6060,change,"Well, we could always go to a movie instead. It's cheaper and at least air conditioned."
6061,joking_sarcastic,"Well, that's what popcorn is for, to through all the people blocking your view."
6062,More_detail,"Well, being in a crowd, among other fans can be an enjoyable part of the experience."
6063,Sympathetic,"Yeah, not to mention all the smells in a stadium and the crowded bathrooms and concessions stands."
6064,change,What song should they have sung instead?
6065,joking_sarcastic,More exciting than that? Oh yeah that song was WAY too boring. I nearly fell asleep!
6066,More_detail,"Exactly. The audience is not exactly low energy, and they need to keep us all engaged."
6067,Sympathetic,Yeah they have so many upbeat songs they could have chosen so it makes no sense to me really to be honest.
6068,change,What politician do you feel does a good job?
6069,joking_sarcastic,Oh yeah politicians really need to CHANGE their tune.
6070,More_detail,I totally agree with that. People are too easily fooled in general.
6071,Sympathetic,Politicians need to be more honest with the constituents and need to have more empathy.
6072,change,"Speaking of not having computers, I saw a pretty cool documentary the other day about all sorts of crazy spy technology that they used in the old days. Now it's just computers and cryptography."
6073,joking_sarcastic,"It's too bad she's not a few generations older, then she'd have all sorts of awesome text communication skills from sending telegrams."
6074,More_detail,"I suppose that's true, but it's still aggravating though. She heard about text abbreviations and it seems like she thinks she can just make any phrase she wants into an acronym."
6075,Sympathetic,"I keep trying to get her to wear her reading glasses when she's texting me, but she learned to type a long time ago and thinks she's just as good on a smartphone as she was touch-typing on an old Royal."
6076,change,"Politics can be exhausting. I try to stay in the know, but it can be so depressing reading the news."
6077,joking_sarcastic,I thought it was a pretty Gouda pun. I'm sure he gets a lot of comments on it.
6078,More_detail,"As long as the slogan isn't offensive, I'm all for it. There are too many t-shirts that just aren't funny."
6079,Sympathetic,The shirt was getting a lot of attention. Even people who like Trump thought it was funny.
6080,change,This is really one of those cases I think of life imitating art - science fiction authors have been writing about this for a hundred years! Do you like sci fi or fantasy better?
6081,joking_sarcastic,So the only question that remains now is what will happen first - zombie apocalypse or the overthrow of humanity by our new Cylon/Terminator overlords?
6082,More_detail,"They can make them appear very realistic, but the real feat is the artificial brain that controls that speech and movement. When we can't tell we're talking to a robot, we're in the future."
6083,Sympathetic,"It can be hard to tell the difference, especially with technology moving as fast as it does. By the time you see the video, they're already working on the next model I bet."
6084,change,"Movies are one thing, but I think music is actually going in the same direction as well."
6085,joking_sarcastic,When it comes to movies I think we should start from scratch. We would be better off going back to the time of silent films.
6086,More_detail,I think sometimes we forget that acting is just as much of a job as any other career. Sometimes you just have to do what you have to do.
6087,Sympathetic,I agree. Directors these days seem to only be making movies for the money.
6088,change,Are there any other sports that you follow closely or would consider watching?
6089,joking_sarcastic,Yeah right you would definitely watch the Super Bowl if it was in our backyard.
6090,More_detail,"Yeah but not the Super Bowl, if anything it is exciting to watch just for the commercials."
6091,Sympathetic,Yeah but it is nice to get together with friends and have some drinks to watch the game.
6092,change,"I do not consider myself to be a fashionable person, but I do like to shop. Shopping is fun."
6093,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, fashion is really important. Its also one of the most boring things to talk about."
6094,More_detail,"Yea, fashion trends are ever changing, but they do seem to be set by the industry."
6095,Sympathetic,"Yea, fashion trends always seem to change. Its difficult to tell why they change, but they do."
6096,change,I prefer to talk about sports. Like lets talk about how bad the phillies are playing this year.
6097,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, lets just find every way to accuse Donald Trump of every single problem we have in this country. Why not?"
6098,More_detail,I  just hate talking about the same things over and over again. Politics gets boring.
6099,Sympathetic,"Yea, it definitely does. I just think we need to find something better to talk about."
6100,change,I'm more of a reality TV kind of gal. Keeping up with the Kardashians anyone?
6101,joking_sarcastic,The only sport I'm interested is the ones revolving around eating pizza & watching netflix.
6102,More_detail,Sports are overrated and boring! How about we talk about something else? Even politics?
6103,Sympathetic,I enjoy football at times. Those Saints are the best in my opinion! WHO DAT?!
6104,change,"What do you think about the new Tom Cruise movie, The Mummy. The visuals look great, but isn't he getting a little old for this kind of film?"
6105,joking_sarcastic,"I need to get me a Tom Cruise bot who can take on an endless ""mission impossible,"" keep my computer free of viruses and wrong information about Hollywood Stars."
6106,More_detail,"But you know, it's called the entertainment ""industry,"" so you know everyone in it has to make a living. TV shows and magazines like Entertainment Weekly get us out and paying for a movie."
6107,Sympathetic,"What bugs me most, though, is all these made up stories on the Internet about movie stars. And when you click on them, sometimes you get a virus attack on your computer. That's way far worse than bad information."
6108,change,"Yea, I just love baseball. Its America's sport. Everything about the sport is amazing."
6109,joking_sarcastic,"Well, would you rather know the end result before watching. This isn't the WWE."
6110,More_detail,"yea, thats the beauty of baseball. You never quite know how its gonna turn out."
6111,Sympathetic,"Yea, any team can win on any given day. It all depends how the team is performing."
6112,change,I also loved watching cartoons. Some of my favorite shows were on cartoon network.
6113,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, they seem to be an afterthought now. I would rather watch little leagues."
6114,More_detail,"Yea, I remember those days. Back when they actually had a good baseball team."
6115,Sympathetic,"Yea, they haven't been able to field a decent team in a long time. Its been a struggle for the padres."
6116,change,"I really want to go see US this year, they are so good."
6117,joking_sarcastic,I feel so old when I realize my first concert was so many years ago!
6118,More_detail,Your right they were both amazing.  Duran Duran was so entertaining and fun.
6119,Sympathetic,"So sad that Michael Jackson has passed, I would have loved to see him."
6120,change,or maybe you are just hungry and naan was referring to the lovely indian bread ... i agree 110% let's go get some curry in a hurry i'll meet you there in 15 minutes.
6121,joking_sarcastic,but at least the bell bottoms were balanced by afros at the top so people didn't tip over
6122,More_detail,"nan ? i'm not sure what you mean by that, but take for example, bell bottom jeans, who in their right mind would wear pants that would get caught in bicycle chains like that eeesh"
6123,Sympathetic,or worse still look at how much fabric there was just dragging along the ground if you were short like me ... i have trouble with regular width pants getting messed up as it is
6124,change,Who's playing the halftime show at the Superbowl this year? Did you see Lady Gaga last year? Girl has pipes.
6125,joking_sarcastic,"If I'm supplying the 60 inch TV, everyone else can provide the food and booze."
6126,More_detail,"I'll usually make a hot dip, a cold dip and something more substantial like pulled pork sliders."
6127,Sympathetic,Finger foods and beer are perfect! You can also have everyone bring a different 6 pack of craft beer to the party so everyone can try different brews.
6128,change,"It seems on the news its mostly involves politics than half about global warming, which I think it should be more of a concern instead"
6129,joking_sarcastic,As long as you know the facts of politics
6130,More_detail,"Yes, getting into a conversation about politics usually caused agruement's even at that age"
6131,Sympathetic,But if you really would like to talk about politics we can
6132,change,Speaking of twitter did you see all the new Bot accounts that are starting to follow Trump?
6133,joking_sarcastic,"Thats funny, they should be the way Trump tweets even at companies that dropped Ivanka's brand."
6134,More_detail,Seriously why does he tweet so many times at the oddest hours of night and the morning.
6135,Sympathetic,It is a shame that they would only stay in line because of his tweets and not because of policy issues.
6136,change,"Maybe that wouldn't be so useful, the air is probably too polluted to be healthy. That's why global environmental regulations are important."
6137,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, if they can't be in a healthy work environment at least they can get their recommended 30 minutes of exercise per day!"
6138,More_detail,"I'm not sure that would work, but we could always try buying clothes that were not made by children."
6139,Sympathetic,"Actually though, it must suck growing up in a factory without recess. We should look into ways to support children like that."
6140,change,"Not as much as I like classical music, do you like any classical music? What is your favorite?"
6141,joking_sarcastic,"No way, Jazz is to old school for my taste. I prefer rock n roll or something more upbeat."
6142,More_detail,Yeah I love Jazz and anything that has Louis Armstrong in it is good for me as well.
6143,Sympathetic,"Yeah I like mostly all music, Jazz is not one of my favorite music genres though."
6144,change,"Yeah, some of the prettiest athletes for my money are in MMA, weirdly enough."
6145,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, definitely. I can definitely think of their faces and names and everything."
6146,More_detail,"For sure, I love all of those slow-motion digs they get deep in that sand."
6147,Sympathetic,"It's one of very few sports I can think of where the uniforms are legitimately the same, haha."
6148,change,I might have plans next weekend do you want to go tomorrow instead? I am free and would still be interested in going.
6149,joking_sarcastic,"Yea right, lets go see that terrible comedy movie I was just mentioning. You couldn't pay me to see that movie."
6150,More_detail,Sure I would love to go but lets not see the comedy movie I am talking about.
6151,Sympathetic,Ok we can do that or anything else that you would like to do I am free and have time.
6152,change,I just like being entertained. I don't care how it occurs.  As long as it happens.
6153,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, why not promote when you have a promoter. Ya know? It does make sense."
6154,More_detail,"yea, they definitely know how to do promotion. They know how to promote themselves."
6155,Sympathetic,I  agree. Thats all part of their profession. They need to be able to do that.
6156,change,"I think that technology definitely has its pros and cons, but I also know that I love my phone."
6157,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, people can just start being even lazier than they already are. What a fun time that will be."
6158,More_detail,"I don't know if thats ever going to change. As more technology comes out, people will become more interested in it."
6159,Sympathetic,I feel like people are always interested in whatever is new. People want new stuff.
6160,change,Well lets hope we get there in time to see everything. I think we should get an early start so we can have dinner before we go and then we can have refreshments when we get there
6161,joking_sarcastic,A quiet concert could be quite relaxing if its a jazz concert but hardly anyone goes to a quiet concert.
6162,More_detail,There are allot good concerts coming to town this summer and I want to make sure that I can get front row seats so that means paying close attention to the ads online or in the local paper so we don't miss one of the good concerts this summer.
6163,Sympathetic,Some concerts get very crowded depending on the band that is scheduled to come
6164,change,"Along with politics, another topic of discussion I usually avoid is religion."
6165,joking_sarcastic,Talking politics only makes thing worse. If we completely ignore whats going on in the world all of our problem with disappear.
6166,More_detail,In reality I don't see a problem with talking politics. I actually think we should all engage more politically with each other and politicians.
6167,Sympathetic,I agree. Everyone has at least some sort of opinion about politics even in the 7th grade.
6168,change,What other bands were you into back then?
6169,joking_sarcastic,Oh yeah I totally think that Stevie Ray Vaughan was talented. Like literally the most talented man on the PLANET!!!
6170,More_detail,Yeah he was definitely a talented guy. I miss music like that to be honest because nowadays a lot of them lack talent.
6171,Sympathetic,I definitely preferred that band too because they made things interesting. Their shows always had something different to bring to the table.
6172,change,"I love watching anything on TV. As long as its a sport, I'm happy. I've never heard of a bad sport ."
6173,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, who wouldn't love watching two teams that you usually hate complete in a big game."
6174,More_detail,"Yea, watching the superbowl is amazing. Its fun to just hang out with family, eat food, and watch great teams play."
6175,Sympathetic,"Yea, I agree. Although, some years, the best part of the game are the commercials."
6176,change,I just feel like robots are going to take over eventually. Whats going to be the point of even having humanity.
6177,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, why not. The government already brainwashes us enough anyway. Why not do it more."
6178,More_detail,"Yea, I can definitely see that happening. I wouldn't put anything past scientists these days. I can tell you that."
6179,Sympathetic,I'm all for anything that can make us smarter and better suited to participate in society.
6180,change,I think accessories play a big role when it comes to fashion as well. How about you?
6181,joking_sarcastic,High fashion is very impractical. Imagine trying to go grocery shopping while wearing a romper made from bubble wrap.
6182,More_detail,High fashion is a waste of time and money in my opinion. I could not imagine paying high dollar for something I likely would only wear once.
6183,Sympathetic,Indeed. I'm sure the ladies at the grocery store love to relax in a worn out t-shirt and comfy sweats anytime they get a chance too.
6184,change,"Some concerts you can never fall asleep at though. Underoath, for instance. They scream so loud there's no way you could sleep. I'm not sure if that's good or bad."
6185,joking_sarcastic,I was at a comedy show where people actually fell asleep.What a nightmare for the comedian. It's like a stage fright nightmare come true.
6186,More_detail,"If you were listening to Duran Duran and you had to wait through an opener, you'd be yawning too."
6187,Sympathetic,"I liked Duran Duran, but sometimes I like seeing smaller bands too. Julien Baker and the Fleet Foxes are two Indie concerts I'm planning to see."
6188,change,"At least the self-driving care is starting to come around. Soon enough, you won't even have to drive yourself anywhere!"
6189,joking_sarcastic,Because submitting work that's not yours is SO ethical. And it's not like school is trying to help you LEARN or anything.
6190,More_detail,"Imagine if technology could start automating stuff like eating food, bathing, or putting on clothes. I'd let a robot do that for me."
6191,Sympathetic,It feels like the point of technology should be to solve problems and make things simpler. But in practice it always ends up becoming a problem unto itself. How much time have you lost troubleshooting the laptop that was supposed to make writing essays simpler?
6192,change,I just like to talk to and meet other people. I find it fun. Its interesting and informative.
6193,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, got forbid we learn something new from someone with opinions different from our own."
6194,More_detail,"Yea, I agree. We usually associate with people that are like minded with us. Thats just the way it works."
6195,Sympathetic,"I agree. Sometimes I wish that wasn't the case, but unfortunately, it usually is."
6196,change,I love going to the bar and socializing with friends over a drink. It is fun.
6197,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, why not get drunk and watch sports. At least I wont mind my team losing then."
6198,More_detail,That is definitely a fun time. I love watching the games at bars with other people.
6199,Sympathetic,"Yea, sometimes you have to watch sports with other people. Otherwise, they get boring."
6200,change,speaking of feed .... what do you say we make plans to go out to supper tonight ? what do you feel like eating ?
6201,joking_sarcastic,"can you see it ? Hey Mom ? when can we empty the oat bags ? i need a new dress for the dance, johnny asked me out. *giggle*"
6202,More_detail,they even made the sacks in prints and people used to look for feed in the sacks with the prints they wanted to make clothing out of so it was to the merchants benefit to stock patterns their patrons would like
6203,Sympathetic,i'm rather glad that you and i can just open a catalog or head to the mall and shop rather than head to the feed store to pick out our fabric
6204,change,"But we don't go to the movies to eat, we go to watch. Are there any other movies on your top ten list for last year that you think I should see?"
6205,joking_sarcastic,I once had a hot dog at the theater so old I thought it was a Slim Jim! I took it back to the concessions stand and told them they needed to give it a good burial.
6206,More_detail,"I haven't seen La La Land yet, I'm waiting for it to come out on cable or on DVD. But speaking of comfort at the movies, I hear they're putting in recliner seats at the theaters now."
6207,Sympathetic,"I haven't been in one of those yet, but that and a few closer bathrooms would make the theater better for everyone. And also fresher popcorn!"
6208,change,nan
6209,joking_sarcastic,The Super Bowls in recent years have been very much less than super in my opinion.
6210,More_detail,Do you remember the baby monkey commercial from the last Super Bowl? That was funny.
6211,Sympathetic,The last few Super Bowls I saw lasted way too long and were very boring. They lasted for hours!
6212,change,I really like to read. I find it fun and relaxing and you can really learn a lot from it.
6213,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, why not just read the magazine and do as it says. That sounds like a good idea."
6214,More_detail,"Yea, I agree. Sometimes you can't just go by the magazine. You have to go by what feels right."
6215,Sympathetic,I completely understand. Whats best for you isn't necessarily what's best for other people.
6216,change,I haven't yet. Do you think the Russians really have hacked into our voting system? I am afraid the whole process is rigged now.
6217,joking_sarcastic,I ran right out there on the first day of registration since of course my vote counts and I am sooooo important as a minority. Riiiighht.
6218,More_detail,I registered yesterday and requested a mail in ballot. It saves a lot of time so you don't have to physically go down to the polling station.
6219,Sympathetic,"Not yet. I am still frustrated at the career politicians just like you are, but maybe we can finally make a difference if we register and vote and get our friend to do the same."
6220,change,Can you imagine if we still had pagers? You know I would be blowing you up all the time.
6221,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, did you hear they're coming out with a new free high speed ISP soon? It's call SkyNet. You don't even have to sign up, it comes to you."
6222,More_detail,"Yeah, but we're just inventing new hassles. Fifteen years ago, we didn't need to instantly send videos and high res images to each other. Fifteen years before that, we didn't need to text each other or always have a phone on us. What will we need fifteen years from now that we can't believe we ever lived without?"
6223,Sympathetic,I agree it does seem to run our lives. Everything we do and how we communicate is completely anchored to it. Now there's no more excuse to be disconnected.
6224,change,"What other choice did they have, do you think Trump will eventually get impeached?"
6225,joking_sarcastic,"No way, half of the Trump cabinet has left or will be out on the way soon."
6226,More_detail,The most surprising was General Flynn who was not recommended by many politicians inside Washington.
6227,Sympathetic,Yeah but that is the same with most politicians when they get elected to hire the members who helped them.
6228,change,What technology do you think they will come out with next? They are alresdy working on self driving cars
6229,joking_sarcastic,"The power went out one time, and my teenager freaked out, she was panicking as her ipad got closer to dying, it was funny"
6230,More_detail,"Like what if theres a technology crash and i lose everything, i dont even know if i can function without technology anymore"
6231,Sympathetic,"Thats true, but its not electronic technology.  But your right, technology is what moves us one step closer to the next thing."
6232,change,How do you feel about pay per view events compared to watching an event live?
6233,joking_sarcastic,Of course! Dealing with massive crowds of rowdy sports fans and power a hundred dollars for a hot dog is the best way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
6234,More_detail,Different strokes for different folks I guess. Watching a game live is a unique experience for sure but some people would rather avoid the crowds.
6235,Sympathetic,Watching a sporting event live is something everyone should experience at least once. Especially if you are a fan of football or boxing.
6236,change,"Hey, that wouldn't be a bad idea. What if we could have information accessible directly to our brains, though some kind of new technological advancement? As long as the surgical insertion didn't hurt too much."
6237,joking_sarcastic,"For some people, maybe we should just surgically graft the phone to their head, or implant a miniature phone into their eyeball!"
6238,More_detail,"The worst is when kids do this at the dinner table. If I had kids, I wouldn't let them have phones with they while we were eating."
6239,Sympathetic,"And drivers who are texting, or talking on their phone, or just looking at it! I'm surprised there aren't more car accidents caused by cell phone usage."
6240,change,How much do you think it costs to sit in those box seats?
6241,joking_sarcastic,"Oh totally, not being in the stands like everyone else is SO superior. Yeah right."
6242,More_detail,Oh yeah totally. I hate overpaying to see sports because they are kind of boring anyway and not worth it.
6243,Sympathetic,"The best course of action is to just watch sports at home on the large tv. That way you don't have to deal with annoying fans, crowds and the heat."
6244,change,"I worry that we're going to have outrage fatigue, that everybody's going to go so used to these overblown reactions that when there's a real crisis everyone will be too jaded to take it seriously."
6245,joking_sarcastic,And we can be outraged about how outraged they are. It's a perfect system!
6246,More_detail,"Yes, it's always somebody screaming about something. If there are real problems in the world then people ought to be able to talk about them in a reasonable way so people can solve them, not just get everybody riled up."
6247,Sympathetic,"Half the time I think the outrage is an act. Oh, look at me, look at how much I care about this issue!"
6248,change,Baseball is OK but I think I would rather watch a pro boxing match. Are you a fan?
6249,joking_sarcastic,Watching 9 innings of baseball is really exciting. When I say exciting I mean as exciting as watching grass grow.
6250,More_detail,I think sports and weather go hand in hand. Bad weather usually means no baseball at least until it clears up.
6251,Sympathetic,I agree. The weather has been all over the place lately. I still can't believe that New York was hit by a hurricane.
6252,change,Yeah well that at least I get that Lamborghini I showed you the other day.
6253,joking_sarcastic,Wow that awesome. You going to be a rich ol' granny. Lol I'm just kidding
6254,More_detail,Yes you are right. There was a study done by the BBB that showed unemployment rates keep rising. That is scary what if jobs just become scarce to us all?
6255,Sympathetic,Yeah I know what you mean. That is why I started to invest to secure my future. I opened a 401k and I invested in some stocks and bonds.
6256,change,But then I remember it is too true.  Has there been anything else in the news lately?
6257,joking_sarcastic,"And then again...some days it all seems like a great big cosmic joke.  Being played on the world.  Like maybe, like on the Dallas show where Pam woke up and Bobby was still alive and the last season had been a bad dream,  that is how I feel this political season might play out.  All a horrible nightmare."
6258,More_detail,I get my news from the internet and the tv.  I like to make sure everyone is on the same page.  Sometimes it is hard to know what is news and what is opinion masquerading as news.
6259,Sympathetic,"I know how hard it is lately to even listen to the news.  Every morning I wake up and say to my husband, ""I wonder what is new in the world of politics this morning?  It seems that every morning there is a new tweet that may shock the world.  It gives me an anxious feeling some days."
6260,change,Every generation is shocked at their innovation.The generation before our parents and grandparents was shocked at adding machines. Socrates was shocked at writing.
6261,joking_sarcastic,Someday we'll be like that. Everyone will be flying cars and computers will be in watches and we'll be so confused.
6262,More_detail,The things my grandma sends me are so cute. She doesn't understand the concept of a Facebook wall and a private message.
6263,Sympathetic,I can't imagine what it would be like to see so much new innovation in my lifetime. From factor development to driverless cars-no wonder it's confusing.
6264,change,Have you heard about how our President decided to not join the France Treaty? I think it was just a bad choice on his part.
6265,joking_sarcastic,State representative have the best jobs. I don't even think they look at the letter that people send to them. Russia owns us rent now. We need to start speaking Russian.
6266,More_detail,"Ya, I ponder on that everyday on if Russia FIXED the the election. It just looks too real with all the facts that we have seen lately. I have written to my state representative before."
6267,Sympathetic,It's just crazy these days knowing that people are more into politics then things like sports. It may actually be a good thing knowing whats going on in the world and what are politicians are doing.
6268,change,"I could never really get into stricter forms of news, even reading the paper is a long drawn out process that's a struggle to make it through."
6269,joking_sarcastic,It's kind of sad that the best and most informative news is fake news isn't it
6270,More_detail,"I've always been a fan of weekend update on SNL, they give me the information I need without the scare tactics."
6271,Sympathetic,It's always fun watching the cast members dress up like they're part of the story. I think it's amazing that former cast members are now on their own shows that I can watch throughout the week.
6272,change,How about our old mode of shopping?  Have you gone to any of the going out of business sales?
6273,joking_sarcastic,"We can all be in a room together, not talking, sending each other messages: how are we going to eat?  how are we going to pay the rent?"
6274,More_detail,"People just can't focus on the job at hand anymore, so many interruptions!"
6275,Sympathetic,"I suppose we can all try to control our own habits.  If you work hard at it, you can minimize the interruptions"
6276,change,"Speaking of TV shows, have you seen the new season of Master of None? It was hysterical!"
6277,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, is that the show where they construct airport runways? Sounds pretty boring!"
6278,More_detail,"Interesting, I've never seen Project Runway but I read an article the other day about a study conducted to determine whether fans of the show were more likely to spend large amounts of money on clothing."
6279,Sympathetic,I wouldn't have anticipated that you would like Project Runway. What aspects of it attracted you?
6280,change,"Sometimes, its fun to keep up with the latest fashion trends. It helps to keep me interested."
6281,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, now I would get beat up for wearing those in public. They are not the most fashionable anymore."
6282,More_detail,"Yea, I remember when  those were in style. Now days, I feel like they just wouldn't quite work."
6283,Sympathetic,"Yea, those were in style for a long time back in the day. That was a fun time."
6284,change,Speaking of rec center are you still on for Basketball tomorrow with the guys at 5pm?
6285,joking_sarcastic,"Another rec center? No way, I swear they just continue to waste taxpayer dollars on anything."
6286,More_detail,Oh yea I read that in the paper it should be built and complete around 2019.
6287,Sympathetic,Although I am tired about politics I do agree that it is important to stay informed with what is going on.
6288,change,"Speaking of flared jeans, do you remember JNCOs? You could make a four man tent out of a single pair of jeans. What were we thinking?"
6289,joking_sarcastic,"Just goes to show - keep your clothes and they'll cycle into fashion again. And if you're too fat to fit into them you can always give them to your daughter, haha."
6290,More_detail,"Oh, I remember the flared jeans, that weird awkward fashion transition between bell bottoms and skinny jeans. I'm pretty sure I still have a couple of pairs."
6291,Sympathetic,I hope you both put on your fresh fashionable outfits and had a girls' day out. Do you have pictures? Please say yes.
6292,change,"with your due date approaching we should go for a walk through the mall, i hear there is a great new store there we can check out for some fabulous baby clothes."
6293,joking_sarcastic,"they say that when you are ready for delivery and have a stubborn baby that exercise helps .... i'll go to the movies with you and we can see an action movie and go up and down the stairs to the restroom as often as you want, maybe that will make other action happen for you"
6294,More_detail,"They make movies to match what society seems to want, but i would like to see more romantic comedies myself"
6295,Sympathetic,good grief it's been a long time since i have been to a theater that had stairs to go up and down to the restroom
6296,change,"So, who was it actually who won the world cup and married the model ? I'd like to know."
6297,joking_sarcastic,"I guess writing your own music could be a bit of a sport within itself, don't you think ? He was very skillful."
6298,More_detail,That was not David Bowie who you are thinking of. David Bowie is a pop singer musician.
6299,Sympathetic,David Bowie's wife was discovered in East Africa by a photographer and shortly after become a supermodel. Could you believe it ?
6300,change,I know Kim Khardashion is into fashion. Look at her these days. She just doesn't stop.
6301,joking_sarcastic,"Well, somedays I would rather not be clued into the latest fashion trends. It helps to keep some money in my pocket."
6302,More_detail,"Yea, well it doesn't sound like you're out of style. It sounds like you know what the style is, but can't afford it."
6303,Sympathetic,"Yea, you are not out of style. You just seem to be having trouble purchasing the latest items."
6304,change,I bet voter turnout will be much higher in 2018 after all the recent oddities.
6305,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, maybe I'll become ""active"" too, and share something on my facebook page, because that will change so much!"
6306,More_detail,"It does seem to have jolted people out of apathy, since a lot of people think they have a duty to really actively push for what they believe in now."
6307,Sympathetic,"You can totally understand why, though, with all the divisive and angry rhetoric being spewed all the time now."
6308,change,Which movie do you think deserved the Oscar?
6309,joking_sarcastic,Yeah moonlight SO deserved that Oscar. I have never seen a better movie in my ENTIRE LIFE!
6310,More_detail,I did not agree with that either. I don't think they were that creative when they voted on that.
6311,Sympathetic,Yeah it stinks sometimes because I feel like other movies were more deserving. Perhaps they were afraid of backlash like they got last year so that is why they gave in.
6312,change,"Speaking of fashion, are you planning to go shopping at the discount stores anytime soon?"
6313,joking_sarcastic,I guess it confirms the old saying - a fool and his money will soon be parted.
6314,More_detail,I couldn't agree more.  Anyone who who spends 50 dollars on a t shirt has more money than common sense.
6315,Sympathetic,They don't seem to realize that the same t shirt will go on sale for 50 percent off at some point so what's the big rush to waste money?
6316,change,Sometimes I like to watch music videos on TV. Those usually hold my interest pretty well.
6317,joking_sarcastic,Why can't we just all be friends. I just wanna like Trump and stop hearing about all his flaws.
6318,More_detail,"Yea, its annoying. He's our president and it sucks, but it is what it is. How much can we keep talking about it."
6319,Sympathetic,I agree. Theres only so much you can say about the same thing. At some point you just have to accept it.
6320,change,I agree but I did not like the most recent designs released by some of the most popular underground designers.
6321,joking_sarcastic,No way I would never shop at local shop that doesnt have high end designer fashion labels.
6322,More_detail,I agree some of the local shops are much more affordable and just as fashionable.
6323,Sympathetic,I prefer department stores but believe that underground designers do have some great fashion sense.
6324,change,I just wish we could all be friends. I like to meet people with all different views.
6325,joking_sarcastic,Who knows. I couldn't be with somebody who support big bad Trump. I know that much.
6326,More_detail,I guess they are very much a like in many other ways. It sorta seems possible.
6327,Sympathetic,They might not think politics are that important or they like listening to other perspectives. Who knows.
6328,change,I don't know why everybody's focused on this maybe-or-maybe-not scandal when there's more than enough to be upset about with that state of which laws are or aren't getting passed.
6329,joking_sarcastic,I'm sure it's very helpful. Will this give you more time to focus on moose and squirrel?
6330,More_detail,"All joking aside, it's a serious issue. It's kind of like what Nixon did to try to put a lid on Watergate."
6331,Sympathetic,"Ha ha. It is kind of comical, everyone freaking out trying to find a culprit when it's not even clear what exactly the crime is supposed to be."
6332,change,You know what makes a great gift? An immersion blender. They're really useful in the kitchen but most people never think to buy them for themselves.
6333,joking_sarcastic,"I don't know, but apropos of nothing MY birthday is coming up pretty soon..."
6334,More_detail,"Probably, I got one for my mom and she uses it all the time now. It was a big hit."
6335,Sympathetic,"That's a good idea, a tablet-style interface is probably a better fit for older people than some other types of devices."
6336,change,Do you think there are any negative connotations associated with the advancement of hand held technology?
6337,joking_sarcastic,I am very much looking forward to a future were we look like cyborgs. I'm going to keep and eye out for the company that makes the first laser shooting eyeball implant.
6338,More_detail,"Technology is such an important part of our lives. I think in the near future everyone will have so many devices that we will all need a special place to store all of our gadgets, Perhaps even inside of our bodies."
6339,Sympathetic,I read articles about future tech gadgets all the time. Lots of them mention that the future will likely see more and more wearable technology. The google goggles are a good example of the direction we are heading in.
6340,change,I dont really like the commercials but was amazed that the Patriots won this year after Brady being suspended.
6341,joking_sarcastic,What? Why would you watch the commercials when you have Tom Brady trying to be the GOAT?
6342,More_detail,"Your right the commercials are the best part, the networks make so much ad revenue."
6343,Sympathetic,Yea I agree watching the commercials are funny and better than some of the games lately.
6344,change,Everyone who shops at Cabella's or Bass Pro Shops sure look like they know what their doing because they dress the part.  Then they get in their Volvos and drive off!
6345,joking_sarcastic,The other day I tried making a charcoal fire for grilling hamburgers.  The only thing I couldn't get to burn was the charcoal.  I sure did burn the burgers though!
6346,More_detail,"I think those shows are staged, just off camera are modern trailers, emergency supplies and satellite telephones!"
6347,Sympathetic,"If you spend any time camping, you are keeping up with basic survival.  That goes for your gardening skills too."
6348,change,"Speaking of morning coffee, I had the best cup at this local coffee house today."
6349,joking_sarcastic,"Oh man, walk much? I know it's hard to put one foot in front of the other, isn't it?"
6350,More_detail,So do you have a lot of cords at your work desk? What's your office space like?
6351,Sympathetic,I'm sorry that sounds awful and I do that all the time myself! All those cords can be such a hassle.
6352,change,I just love to be outside and viewing scenery. It is nice. I enjoy it. It is fun.
6353,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, its a great sport. Who wouldn't love a ball hitting a bat and fans screaming."
6354,More_detail,"Yea, I went to a ton with my dad. They were always fun and cheap as a kid."
6355,Sympathetic,"Yea, baseball games were always fun. They were enjoyable and perfect for large groups."
6356,change,It's good for politicians to have a strong moral compass. You need it in that kind of an environment.
6357,joking_sarcastic,Some politicians don't have it figured out until twenty years in the senate. And they want to stay in the senate forever too.
6358,More_detail,"haha I talk about politics so much that people either love me or hate me, so it's easy."
6359,Sympathetic,"Yes, most senators and congressmen don't really know what their political views are either. They just vote for the things or people that support them."
6360,change,Maybe if the crowds were a little more bored then they wouldn't charge $100 for a hoodie. Do you ever go to the merch table?
6361,joking_sarcastic,"I think when the audience starts to get bored the solution is to immediately go to a battle of the bands format. If you get booed off stage, the fans get a refund and go home. That'll raise the stakes."
6362,More_detail,"That is the absolute worst when the crowd is bored. Then it channels into the band, then back to the crowd, and it ruins the whole show. I've been to a few like that."
6363,Sympathetic,"Well I mean most people don't get too pumped for the first openers. Except for that small group of weird fans who are just there for the opening band, haha. There's always some of those."
6364,change,Some teams are just bad. The Cleveland Browns are the same way. So are the Oakland Raiders. And those are in football.
6365,joking_sarcastic,You can always hope they'll win in a hundred years though. That worked for Chicago (and sort of Cleveland) in the last World Series!
6366,More_detail,It just shows they need a change. Maybe a new coach will make a difference. Sometimes that works in football. I think it did with a team in Arizona.
6367,Sympathetic,"I think people watch it for enjoyment though. Even if the team doesn't win, it's for the experience, the cheering. It's such an American thing."
6368,change,And we would go outside all the time. Remember when we didn't all have video games and we had to make our own fun?
6369,joking_sarcastic,"Oh boy, I can't wait until they finally build Skynet so computers take over the world already, since, y'know, they haven't done that ALREADY."
6370,More_detail,And now Amazon is trying to create an entire store without any cashiers or baggers! You know if they find a way to get rid of the people restocking stuff they'd do it.
6371,Sympathetic,"It seems people are taking the things we do everyday and trying to almost make games out of them. Now, you don't just talk to people, you have to do it in a way that gets likes."
6372,change,"Speaking of obligations as a citizen, have you ever had jury duty? Everybody always takes about ways to get out of it, but I think it might be interesting. I never get called, though."
6373,joking_sarcastic,"I don't know, maybe we should try a system where everybody passive-aggressively ignores everybody else and see if that works better."
6374,More_detail,"We do, but it seems like some of the gulfs are too big to bridge. We've got survivalist nuts out in the hills and protesters on college campuses, can people that different every really get along?"
6375,Sympathetic,"That's true, I just wish we could let politicians handle it and not worry about it all the time. Isn't that supposed to be why we have a representative democracy instead of a direct one?"
6376,change,"Speaking about fashion, I need to get to the dry cleaners before they close."
6377,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, yeah, I'm so old fashioned!  Then why do they keep wearing my old jeans from my high school days???"
6378,More_detail,Jeans are wonderful!  They indestructible.  I'm glad something that never goes out of style is comfortable to wear.
6379,Sympathetic,"Just hang on to your good clothes, they always come back in style eventually."
6380,change,Speaking of technology did you see the new apple computer that was just released?
6381,joking_sarcastic,What are you talking about? There is no way we should be having this conversation it is dumb.
6382,More_detail,But wouldnt we have the same or equal technology to combat any Nazi advances like we did?
6383,Sympathetic,I am not sure plus I am happy there are no Nazis with advanced technology nowadays.
6384,change,You also have those people who get too angry when someone's beliefs are different.
6385,joking_sarcastic,"I mean, how many rational Trump supporters do you really know? They're not exactly lining up in our area."
6386,More_detail,I can see that because if they back people with extreme beliefs they might be extreme themselves.
6387,Sympathetic,I know it can be hard to find out your friends have hateful or unreasonable beliefs.
6388,change,I always wanted to play sports when I was younger. I thought that it would be fun and rewarding.
6389,joking_sarcastic,"Eh, sports players don't make that much do they? Its not like they make millions."
6390,More_detail,"Yea, if you take pride in your hometown's teams, you will watch sports regardless of the situation."
6391,Sympathetic,I think sports are fun to watch. Sometimes you have to just understand that they are still a game though. Its supposed to be fun
6392,change,I wish that I was paid more for being a teacher. That would be nice. I would greatly appreciate that!
6393,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, well having a nice amount of money in your pocket from playing a game wouldn't exactly deter me either."
6394,More_detail,"yea, that can be true sometimes, but I also think that some players truly enjoy playing. That is obvious."
6395,Sympathetic,"Yea, I think that most players like to play the sport that they play though. Money is icing on the cake."
6396,change,Yeah but even sadder is how everyone is so out of touch due to reality. You can't even have a full conversation with someone these days without them reaching for their phone.
6397,joking_sarcastic,Are you seriously lamenting that you don't love like the Jetsons or Biff from Back to the Future?
6398,More_detail,Technology has indeed exploded in the past decade or so from a select educated few to the general public and everyday use.
6399,Sympathetic,"True but at the same time the things we want that still aren't available aren't trivial toys. Things like jet packs and flying cars could be dangerous if they rushed to deliver just for the sake of ""keeping up"""
6400,change,Have you every gone to a CosPlay? Or maybe a ComicCon? Those people have to be a little weird. (Any my apologies to you if you answered yes to either one of my questions!)
6401,joking_sarcastic,Maybe one of them will even win a prize at a CosPlay convention! Much of my clothing could be put together to make a pretty good approximation of a superhero costume.
6402,More_detail,I've got boxes of my old clothes in a closet upstairs in my house. I used to love to dress up in my mother's old clothes when I was a kid.
6403,Sympathetic,"Of course, I don't have any kids yet, but even if I never have any, some kids, somewhere, are going to enjoy wearing my clothes as costumes."
6404,change,Would you rather watch football live after a couple of hours of tailgating or would you rather watch a baseball game live?
6405,joking_sarcastic,Adam Sandler probably cannot even play a sport very well so it is a good thing he is an actor.
6406,More_detail,"I like sports movies too, but I like more of the drama sort of sports movies especially football movies."
6407,Sympathetic,"Sometimes, I feel like I am a part of the movie and I feel really sad when a player has a season or career ending injury."
6408,change,I can't remember the last time there has been so many changes in leadership of so many departments this quickly.
6409,joking_sarcastic,"Though I do have to admit, the news these days is certainly a lot more entertaining than it has been in awhile."
6410,More_detail,When it comes to politics these days it's anyone's guess whose for or against anybody.
6411,Sympathetic,This election is even harder to pin down a side. The best camp to be in seems to change on a dime.
6412,change,"I really like when the character starts out one way, then completely changes by the end of the film. Like from safe and ordinary to crazy and wild. Do you know what I mean?"
6413,joking_sarcastic,"You know who does that, is Michael Cera. When he's 50 years old he'll still be playing an awkward teenager!"
6414,More_detail,"Yeah, like a ""red shirt"" on Star Trek. Or one of those character actors that work for decades playing the same guy in different films."
6415,Sympathetic,"It's always fun to see an actor be versatile and pull of something you've never seen before, especially when they do it really well."
6416,change,Are you going to watch the Comey testimony or do you have something better to do - like sort your sock drawer?
6417,joking_sarcastic,The only ones benefitting from all the chaos and drama are the media who are getting better ratings and more subscriptions and the high-priced Washington lawyers who get rich whenever there is a scandal.
6418,More_detail,I got tired of hearing about Trump's stupid tweets and how his people cover for him a long time ago.
6419,Sympathetic,He's only been in office less than six months but it seems like six years.
6420,change,Me too I like Gary Clark Jr. Who is your favorite artist that you like to watch perform?
6421,joking_sarcastic,What do you mean you dont work out much? You were in the gym yesterday and this morning!
6422,More_detail,Yeah there are some great artist performances coming up for the Summer I cannot wait.
6423,Sympathetic,I like the social media pages of athletes and actors that bring about awareness to worthwhile causes.
6424,change,I wonder when we will start to see designing integrating technology into fashion design.
6425,joking_sarcastic,Fashion goes in cycles. Pretty soon we will see everyone walking around in bell bottoms again.
6426,More_detail,Being fashionable is fine but I prefer to keep it simple. Jeans and t-shirts will never go out of style.
6427,Sympathetic,I agree. With or without crowds I try to keep the time I spend inside of any store to a minimum
6428,change,What did you the think of Trump and hiliary election? I disliked both of them for president
6429,joking_sarcastic,"Its kind of funny when they promise all these things, and everyone votes for them and then they dont do any of it."
6430,More_detail,"Politicians want the power to be able to control other people, they arent leaders."
6431,Sympathetic,"Exactly, they really dont do anything in their last term, i guess they dont see the point."
6432,change,How about current events in pop culture? It's sure some crazy stuff going on there.
6433,joking_sarcastic,I'd rather experience a sick burn on my tongue from a hot pocket fresh out the microwave than discuss politics.
6434,More_detail,Political debates are a waste of time. It's just going to be two people who arguing over what they think is wrong and right.
6435,Sympathetic,I think it's important to be political at times. We are believe in something and want to make a change so let's talk about it.
6436,change,"Do you use Twitter? There's a lot of good stuff there, but you have to know who to follow."
6437,joking_sarcastic,You won't catch me posting anything that resembles the severed body part of the President! Did you see that on Twitter?
6438,More_detail,"I think if you vary your television watching, watch a little political news, switch to a comedy, watch a movie or a rerun of a drama, you can keep your cool pretty good."
6439,Sympathetic,"A good citizen is ANYONE who follows politics these days, and thinks about it. So many people just get a little bit of information and just react, and usually too strongly, I think."
6440,change,"I prefer to follow local politics, I feel like our local politicians really want to make more of a difference in our daily lives."
6441,joking_sarcastic,Oh during the political commercials I consider that time to get up and get a snack.
6442,More_detail,I know I can't stand even watching Trump he is so over confident and pompous.
6443,Sympathetic,It's sad the state of politics that exists in our country right now especially at the federal level.
6444,change,Do you think Congressman and Senators should have term limits just like the president does?
6445,joking_sarcastic,"If you plan to get married, you definitely need to make sure your partner has the same political views as you or it will be a quick divorce."
6446,More_detail,I do not like to talk about politics with anyone except my wife because I hate to fight over stupidity.
6447,Sympathetic,I feel sorry for people who can not see the stupidity that politicians seem to come up with.
6448,change,I saw a cute floral romper at Target. Those are hard to pull off but so cute when you do.
6449,joking_sarcastic,"I'm going to buy a pair and fill every single pocket. Some pockets will have snacks. Some will have pizza. I'll hang a hammer on that loop, kind of like a poor man's Thor."
6450,More_detail,I don't like cargo shorts too much. I think it was a fad from the 90s that never died.
6451,Sympathetic,I think there's better shorts to choose from lately. I really like those above the knee bright colored shorts.
6452,change,"Then again, too much effort is also bad, right?"
6453,joking_sarcastic,Potato sacks looks great! What are you taking about? They are the BEST outfits!
6454,More_detail,I totally agree. Some people do not want to put in the effort to look any good unfortunately.
6455,Sympathetic,People need to start putting more effort in how they dress.
6456,change,Sometimes it seems like they spend more time promoting the movie than thinking about the plot with some of the flops that have come out recently.
6457,joking_sarcastic,Pretty soon they'll be using computer generated replicas so they can make appearances all over the world at the same time.
6458,More_detail,"It certainly is a good way to get information out, but it does seem to get worse with each new blockbuster."
6459,Sympathetic,"SNL always has the latest projected smash star on to host, though it is usually fun to watch."
6460,change,"Speaking of concerts, have you had any problems lately buying tickets on Stub Hub?"
6461,joking_sarcastic,The Stones' latest album is Blues so I guess they are finally figuring out what the Allman Brothers knew years ago
6462,More_detail,My all time favorite concert was the Allman Brothers.  They were just amazing in live performance when they were really on their game.
6463,Sympathetic,I agree that they are one of the best live performance bands of all time but I would put the Stones ahead of them on the list.
6464,change,That's true. Apparently Steven Tyler's drug use altered his memory so much that he heard an Aerosmith song on the radio and didn't even remember making it! Some of those hard drugs are pretty scary.
6465,joking_sarcastic,Plus live large crowds and live drunk people! Everything's better when it's live!
6466,More_detail,Sometimes that can be pretty entertaining. Once my friend went to a concert and saw a band member hit someone with a cucumber!
6467,Sympathetic,"Wow, sounds like you had a bad experience at a live concert - do you want to talk about it?"
6468,change,I just wish that Hillary would have won the presidency. We would never have to talk about this.
6469,joking_sarcastic,"I like to think anybody who blasts Trump is smart, but I guess it isn't always the case."
6470,More_detail,"Yea, she is not the sharpest tool in the shed. She has said her fair share of awful things"
6471,Sympathetic,"Yea, she sometimes isn't that smart, but she makes herself sound dumber than she really is."
6472,change,"I love technology. I feel like as long as we are getting more, things will be okay."
6473,joking_sarcastic,Who knows. I just know there is too much damn technology.Its getting ridiculous.
6474,More_detail,I am not really in a position to answer that I don't think I leave that to people who know what they are doing.
6475,Sympathetic,"Yea, that is a really good question. I don't really know what the criteria is these days. Its interesting to think about."
6476,change,Have you ever played baseball?  I played for rec ball it was really fun and enjoying.
6477,joking_sarcastic,"I think its funny when someone hits a homerun, and the guys in the outfield try and jump up and catch it when everyone knows its pointless."
6478,More_detail,I prefer watching sports in the evening time though.  I dont want to have to get up early to watch sports
6479,Sympathetic,"Yes i agree.  Baseball is fun to watch to, its a very addictive sport to watch on televisiom."
6480,change,Have you ever been to Las Vegas ? It's another place to visit that is fun. There are plenty of cacti there and sand.
6481,joking_sarcastic,Hollywood is a good place if you like the heat. It is a spectacular place if you enjoy long walks on the beach too.
6482,More_detail,Disneyland is a fun place. I have been there several times as a kid and look forward to visiting again sometime in the future.
6483,Sympathetic,Disneyland would be a fun place to work in the summer. Could you imagine working at a place like that ?
6484,change,"My mother is doing great at the nursing home, she seems to enjoy piano lessons a lot."
6485,joking_sarcastic,"It reminded me of the Trump "" Covfefe"" tweet that he recently sent that broke the internet"
6486,More_detail,"She recently sent me a message I couldn't decipher, I had to drive three hours to her house to talk to her."
6487,Sympathetic,It's a pity though that everyone is ignoring them instead of trying to create tech that is friendly to them.
6488,change,"If you had to watch a sport, what sport would you watch? Why is this the sport you would watch?"
6489,joking_sarcastic,"Ha, we get to hear them whine when they don't play well.  They can be some of the biggest babies."
6490,More_detail,I know it is great following them during the off season too and seeing where they might travel.
6491,Sympathetic,It is really sad when an athlete is on the road and they lose someone close to them.  I feel their pain in those instances.
6492,change,I like doing anything as long as I'm surrounded by good people. Thats the best.
6493,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, nothing better than watching a boring movie and drinking expensive popcorn."
6494,More_detail,"Yea, thats pretty much the way that it goes, but its still fun. I enjoy it at least."
6495,Sympathetic,"Yea, going to the movies is fun, but its good for special occasions. It gets pricy."
6496,change,"I still haven't seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy, I'd much rather go to that."
6497,joking_sarcastic,"The DC Cinematic Universe movies have been SOOO great, how could I possibly refuse?"
6498,More_detail,"That sounds like fun, I hear it's much more heroic than some of the other alleged superhero movies we've been getting lately."
6499,Sympathetic,"OK, that sounds interesting. I'm not sure a World War I period piece is a good fit for a superhero movie, but I'm willing to give it a shot."
6500,change,What was the name of the last group that you saw in concert? I do not even remember the last concert that I attended.
6501,joking_sarcastic,Paying $400 for a ticket is somewhat too rich for my blood. It is cheaper to buy the Cd's for your favorite group.
6502,More_detail,Trying to purchase tickets online can be very challenging also. Buying online can create security risks.
6503,Sympathetic,"If it is a concert that you really want to go to, it is best to purchase the tickets as soon as they go on sale especially if it is a popular group. You do not want to fall into the hands of someone selling fake tickets."
6504,change,What about autonomous vehicles? What do you think about how they will affect our economy?
6505,joking_sarcastic,"One day, you're going to be like my parents and have to call YOUR kid to help you turn on your computer."
6506,More_detail,The amount of information we now have at our fingertips is amazing. It has certainly changed the way we communicate and how information is shared. I barely use anything but my smartphone these days to go on the internet.
6507,Sympathetic,It's great! Do you have a smart TV? What features do you have? Ours has YouTube and Pandora.
6508,change,"There's something fun about the ritual of interacting with the people, getting your tickets, having them hand you your stub back. I really miss that when I watch movies at home."
6509,joking_sarcastic,"And as an added bonus you get to deal with all the downtown traffic, that's nice, too."
6510,More_detail,"I find that once I get sucked into a movie I don't really notice what the seats are like, all my attention is focused on what's going on in the story."
6511,Sympathetic,"I like buildings that have a bit of history to them, it makes the whole experience feel a bit more special."
6512,change,Styles have definitely changed over the years. I am content with the current styles of this generation.
6513,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I just like to laugh at people wearing crazy stuff so in my eyes, just keep being weird folks."
6514,More_detail,"Yea, I think its funny when people wear things that they are going to regret later. I laugh at it."
6515,Sympathetic,"Me too, but just imagine how much torture they will go through if people decide to make fun of what they are wearing."
6516,change,You know what else bugs me is that tiny breakroom. Like one fridge and microwave is enough for almost a hundred employees?
6517,joking_sarcastic,"As a matter of fact, my overall productivity levels drop precisely 11.5% when I am wearing 2 inch heels. I lose another percent for every cm in height."
6518,More_detail,"Honestly, it makes me less productive when I am wearing rigid and uncomfortable clothing. I'd be a better employee in sneaks and sweats."
6519,Sympathetic,I do wish it was more casual. I think we put too much importance on worrying about what people are wearing over what they're doing.
6520,change,Do you feel this way about all awards shows?
6521,joking_sarcastic,Oh yeah the Oscars have a MAJOR influence on politics. I mean they have MORE power than the president!
6522,More_detail,I agree that the oscars are too political. That is why they are alienating their conservative base because no one wants to be told how to look at situations.
6523,Sympathetic,The Oscars are becoming way too politically correct for my liking. They are becoming to the point where everyone deserves a trophy and I do not enjoy that one bit. I agree with you that they are becoming too political and unfortunately Hollywood doesn't have enough conservatives to voice opinions.
6524,change,"Yes, would you want to take them off my hands? I had a family obligation come up for next week."
6525,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, looking forward to seeing how far the deflated balls go this time! If I decide I don't want to go, maybe I can sell them for 10 cents each."
6526,More_detail,"Yes I do! I'm really looking forward to it. Even though the last game isn't worth talking about, they have been playing pretty good this season."
6527,Sympathetic,"Yes, I hope you can get your hands on a pair too. I've heard they are sold out."
6528,change,My thing though is I'm a huge window shopper. I waste so much time just going and looking at things I never buy!
6529,joking_sarcastic,"Oh well, at least the fashion industry promotes a safe and well paid marketplace of third world sweat factory workers that slave over the garments we buy, wear twice, and then toss into the donation bin. Oh, wait a second."
6530,More_detail,I have no doubt of that. They must have marketing panels and statisticians whose sole purpose is to identify fashion trends and come up with formulas to make the most money. Period.
6531,Sympathetic,"It's a shame too because I'm sure the designers want to be artists and make something meaningful and beautiful, but the bottom line is all that matters to the company."
6532,change,I also find it interesting when actors go behind the camera and start directing films.
6533,joking_sarcastic,"They have older actors now? You could have fooled me, I don't think I saw anybody over 40 in the last film I watched."
6534,More_detail,"I like to see actors sort of transform themselves, like Bill Murray who started out doing just comedy but then moved into more dramatic roles."
6535,Sympathetic,"Yes, although sometimes it's disappointing to see a famous actor in a role where they don't really fit the part, I think they need to strike a balance."
6536,change,My favorite is after the movie when you have that first real conversation - and decide what you're going to do after you walk out of the theater.
6537,joking_sarcastic,"My go to is to dissect the movie previews and see if they join in. If so, I know I'm on the right track for romance."
6538,More_detail,"Plus there's always something to discuss - the wretched concession prices, the movie posters, and of course the movie goers themselves."
6539,Sympathetic,I prefer the movie theater first date to the restaurant first date. With a movie to watch and respond to you can kind of feel each other out before doing the obligatory social interview.
6540,change,"It will be lost in all the diversions they are creating, did you hear about his Tweets abou the London terror attacks?"
6541,joking_sarcastic,"""I'm going to fix everything in the first 100 days!""  Yeah Mr. Trump you can't fire everyone who doesn't do what you want without push back."
6542,More_detail,How True!  Can you imagine if this was in JFK's time?  Hoover would have a fit!
6543,Sympathetic,I'm sure this will all come out in the wash eventually and we'll all know the truth.
6544,change,Speaking of charitable donations do you actually want to join me and donate to a good cause this weekend at the church?
6545,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah right, fashion shows in Milan and Paris are not deductible as charitable donations I hope you are kidding."
6546,More_detail,"Absolutely not, I hope your kidding. Charitable donations are not exactly tied to fashion shows."
6547,Sympathetic,"Charitable donations are important part of the tax code that should only be used for real purposes, not fashion shows. Real charities should only be deducted from your gross income."
6548,change,"Since you don't follow trends, do you follow the news? I hear so many people who don't know what happening in the world because they are following their ""news"" on social media and such."
6549,joking_sarcastic,"You're a style icon? That's a interesting title to have these days. Do they pay good? I was looking into that job a few years back, lol."
6550,More_detail,I would consider myself a style icon also. I don't do trends especially with whats out there nowadays. It's just crazy.
6551,Sympathetic,Being a style icon sets you apart from the rest of the crowd. I like that. You get to wake up in the morning knowing that someone is going to follow your trend.
6552,change,"Sometimes I think athletes get paid too much, but some don't get paid enough. College athletes don't get paid at all."
6553,joking_sarcastic,haha what if your dad was famous for sports but you were horrible? That wouldn't be any fun at all even if you had money.
6554,More_detail,You'd probably be more likely to go into sports if your mom or dad was famous. It would be inspiring.
6555,Sympathetic,Those lucky children. But imagine getting ratted out because you chose to miss a game for your child's birth or graduation. Horrible.
6556,change,Goal ball is this sport for the blind and there'll never be a movie about that.
6557,joking_sarcastic,I know they'll never make a sports movie about a disabled athlete even though that would be so great.
6558,More_detail,Ladybugs is a funny sports movie about a boy who gets on the girls' soccer team and has to pretend to be a girl.
6559,Sympathetic,I also like Remember the Titans because it's sort of historical and kind of uplifting without being preachy.
6560,change,"I think that it is important to continue to make innovative technology. The more knowledge we have, the better."
6561,joking_sarcastic,"Well, eventually technology will take over our lives anyway. Why not let it do that now."
6562,More_detail,"Yea, sometimes technology scares me, but it is definitely mostly good. We can do a lot that we couldn't do before."
6563,Sympathetic,"Yea, technology is a nice tool to have, but we shouldn't let it completely rule our lives. Thats for sure."
6564,change,How about local politics?  Who do you think should be the mayor of our city?
6565,joking_sarcastic,Well I guess we can count the days until his term is up!
6566,More_detail,"The last election was a really scary time, I still can't believe that he won."
6567,Sympathetic,I was really hoping to witness our first female president being elected.
6568,change,"What's your favorite movies to go see, I've always been partial to action movies, seeing those huge explosions on scene really get me on the edge of my seat"
6569,joking_sarcastic,"You know, it's starting to sound like I've been wasting a lot of money when I could have just been going with you."
6570,More_detail,"I've never been to that one, I usually go to Imax to get the full surround experience, but it sounds like Cinemark is worth checking out."
6571,Sympathetic,"Maybe we could go together this weekend, my treat; you could show me what I've been missing."
6572,change,"However, I super love history about the Tudors and Kings and stuff like that."
6573,joking_sarcastic,I'm pretty dumb about wars and American history and the like. I want to know more but always get bored!
6574,More_detail,"I don't know much about D-Day except it seems to be a really big deal, and it was between America and Japan."
6575,Sympathetic,"I feel like it's super sad, I see stuff on t.v. about it and everyone is so somber."
6576,change,How about these new curved TVs they're selling now? And are they expensive! They're always coming up with something to keep us challenged.
6577,joking_sarcastic,My parents still have an old black and white TV in the basement. I think they put it down there for the cat to watch. No special technological skills needed for a set like that.
6578,More_detail,"Do your parents use any other technology, like a cell phone or the Internet? Lots of old folks are always needing help with those."
6579,Sympathetic,Your parents must have a pretty nice TV. Is it one of those really big ones? Do they have cable with a DVR?
6580,change,"Waiting on the world to change involves tolerant thinking and thinking outside the box, maybe the choosers should put on blindfolds."
6581,joking_sarcastic,"but if we don't allow all smart people to participate we won't have a diversity in our technological creations, if we let everyone participate maybe we can be more advanced into the future."
6582,More_detail,Technology has done allot to advance the way we do things today and I so glad that we have technology that is advancing
6583,Sympathetic,"As long as smart people are allowed to take part and are allowed to create without bias, our technological advances will continue"
6584,change,That's so true.  And what about the fashions back then?  Would you wear any of the styles today?
6585,joking_sarcastic,Absolutely.  They are about a million years old now.  But they look better than I feel!
6586,More_detail,You're right.  They are very old now.  Where did the years go?  It seems like just yesterday.
6587,Sympathetic,I agree.  Did you think they looked good back in the day?  Did you have a favorite?
6588,change,"Fenway is OK, but sometimes I like catching a good boxing match at a local pub with a lively crowd."
6589,joking_sarcastic,I absolutely refuse to watch a game at any other ball park. Anything outside of Fenway is simply uncivilized.
6590,More_detail,"I like watching sports almost anyplace I have a chance. Sometimes I enjoy watching a game live in person in an arena, But I can also have a lot of fun catching a good ball game at home with a few friends and family."
6591,Sympathetic,I would have to say Fenway is also one of my favorites. I have never really enjoyed myself as much anywhere else. It's legendary.
6592,change,"Oh, I'm sorry, did you vote for Trump? Whew, I'm glad you didn't. Don't want to get into a fist fight now. But what about that Comey hearing? They say it's going to be popcorn time this Friday, so many people are going to be watching it."
6593,joking_sarcastic,As if having Trump for president doesn't already make us look like a Nation of Losers.
6594,More_detail,"That is just bonkers. Are you a rich person? If you are, that tax plan is for you!"
6595,Sympathetic,What they really need is tax REFORM. That Republican proposal is just a giveaway for the wealthy. Plus it's going to really hurt all of us in so many other ways.
6596,change,I think Eisenhower was a great president. He was able to hide anything he did.
6597,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, who knows when they are going to be bombed. The president sure was slick."
6598,More_detail,It seems like he was a very secretive person. Eisenhower liked to do a lot of things in secrecy.
6599,Sympathetic,"He definitely was a good president, but he was able to do this by being discrete all the time."
6600,change,Did you watch the Super Bowl this year?  What an amazing game.
6601,joking_sarcastic,"The Olympics are so exciting, I hope the next city is a little more prepared than Rio was to host the games!"
6602,More_detail,I really enjoy watching the olympics.  My favorite sport is the gymnastics it's so entertaining.
6603,Sympathetic,Remember when Tonya Harding injured Nancy Kerrigan?  That was so sad.
6604,change,"Yea, I just love witnessing new technology come out all the time. Its always updating."
6605,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, why not just get it. You seem to have everything else, don't you? It sure seems like it."
6606,More_detail,"Yea, that would be nice, but its cool even without that. Eventually, I'm sure you will get it."
6607,Sympathetic,"Yea, with the new technology always coming out, eventually everybody will have everything."
6608,change,"Speaking of Star Trek, did you ever really like the Trek movies as much as the show?"
6609,joking_sarcastic,"What? No one talked about flip phones like communicators from Trek, at least I never heard that."
6610,More_detail,I still have a flip phone that I use for emergencies that I take with me everywhere.
6611,Sympathetic,"Right, I think flip phones should be re done and make a comeback. I would buy one."
6612,change,Sure fashion is a industry that makes a lot of money.  Just thinking about shopping reminds me I need to pay of credit card from my trip to the mall.
6613,joking_sarcastic,OMG I know some of those outfits look like something from another planet.  I mean really who buys that stuff?
6614,More_detail,"Some of the things they wear are crazy, but there are some things they model that I would actually wear and that are trendy."
6615,Sympathetic,Just think about how much it actually costs to make the clothing and how much mark-up we actually pay.  Do they really need to make that much money?
6616,change,"I think that beside of  the audiences low energy,  The lighting in the area was lit very well. Also,  it was a pack crowd that night."
6617,joking_sarcastic,It was almost like they were playing little kid songs. Who wants to be attentive to that? Duran Duran are becoming less and less entertaining to the their audience.
6618,More_detail,I believe you are right. I looked at how Duran Duran was performing and I notice one of the members were totally off beat with everything. Maybe he was having a bad night but he was messing everything up.
6619,Sympathetic,The audience was also looking at the lighting that was going in different directions. I don't think the performance in total was planned correctly. Everything just seemed off.
6620,change,"Fair enough, did you catch last night's game? That play by number 25 was amazing!"
6621,joking_sarcastic,Why? Is it because nobody ever agrees with your backwards logic? You must be a liberal!
6622,More_detail,"Although talking politics may be uncomfortable for some, it's a topic that should be talked about none the less. It can help you understand both perspectives."
6623,Sympathetic,"I agree, some people take it to far where the informational conversation ends up being a hurtful conversation."
6624,change,Is there anything else that you enjoyed to watch on TV Sunday Mornings like cartoons?
6625,joking_sarcastic,Why not? Baseball is a great sport and some people argue it is to slow but I think it is just right.
6626,More_detail,"Who likes baseball anyways? It is an outdated sport and needs to be improved in some way, game play is too slow."
6627,Sympathetic,"I always watched football when I was younger and was never much of a baseball fan, the game is too slow."
6628,change,Hpw big do you think the new ipad will be?  They always think you need somethong bigger.
6629,joking_sarcastic,"I wish i had a time traveling car like back to the future, that would be fun to go anywhere"
6630,More_detail,An ipad makes my life so easy and i can do anything with it.  I could control my whole house with it if i wanted to.
6631,Sympathetic,"It is so cool, when you think about it that way. I wonder what the world will be like in twenty years."
6632,change,I enjoy how fashions vary from country to country too. Fashion in Europe is so much edgier than fashion in the U.S.
6633,joking_sarcastic,haha imagine old ugly trends coming in- designers convincing people to get an entire eighties wardrobe just for a season!
6634,More_detail,"It's just a ploy for them to get more money, in the end. We buy and buy and waste and waste and they profit."
6635,Sympathetic,But fashions circle around too. People buy vintage clothes because they are cool. It's funny.
6636,change,"We can see these issues relevant today, don't you agree?"
6637,joking_sarcastic,Yeah we really need to be worrying about THAT right now.
6638,More_detail,"Exactly. We never think about the consequences, and we usually are focused on the benefits rather than drawbacks."
6639,Sympathetic,You make a fabulous point in that we need to be more careful and aware of great negativities at technology brings us.
6640,change,What I love is when a movie like that actually turns out to be good on accident - like a cult classic. Do you know any movies like that?
6641,joking_sarcastic,"Oh that movie? Nah, it just looks silly but really it's a very deep and detailed historical documentary. Yep, history with fart jokes and fat suits."
6642,More_detail,"That is absolutely the case. It's like they have a set formula for how much they net in tickets vs how much the studio spent on the movie, and they only want to hit that line. They don't care about making art; it's just pulp."
6643,Sympathetic,"You're right, they probably only did do it for the money. I wonder how often they really regret it after the movie comes out and they see what the whole thing looks like."
6644,change,"If you think it's bad in politics don't even get me started on corporate CEOs, I'm not sure they even have consciences, just predictions about what a statement will do to their stock price."
6645,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe things will evolve to the point where politicians say nothing but ludicrously implausible tall tales. ""When I leapt out of the helicopter to wrestle the 90 foot python, that's when I knew what our tax policy should be."""
6646,More_detail,"That's the truth. I don't think we're going to be getting another Honest Abe or George Washington any time soon, so we need to figure something out."
6647,Sympathetic,"The problem is that everybody's afraid to make the first move. They're afraid to run an honest campaign because they'll probably lose to somebody who doesn't care about the truth, just about winning."
6648,change,Speaking about making america great again who did you vote for Clinton or Trump?
6649,joking_sarcastic,That funny how could you care more about a t-shirt slogan than his actual policies I bet.
6650,More_detail,Yeah but the last thing Trump is doing is making america great again with his policies.
6651,Sympathetic,The important thing is to laugh with Trump not making the changes the way he said he would campaigning.
6652,change,I have enjoyed every second of Tom Brady's long career. He has been one heck of a football player.
6653,joking_sarcastic,"Well, if you had a hot wife, she would be shown on TV too. Everybody knows what gets viewers."
6654,More_detail,"Yea, they always seem to focus on her. She is pretty much as famous as he is."
6655,Sympathetic,"Yea, Tom Brady just seems to have it all. Amazing football player, person, and has an amazing wife."
6656,change,"Speaking of zombies, do you watch any of those shows? Like Walking Dead, etc.? I don't, but I really liked the movie ""28 Days Later"" which was I think one of the first zombie movies."
6657,joking_sarcastic,"But hey, without politics, we'd only have comedies and zombie shows to entertain us. Some of these politicians remind me of zombies!"
6658,More_detail,"Do you ever read the trending topics on Twitter? So much of that is political, and there are some crazies out there."
6659,Sympathetic,"I'm not saying you and I are crazy, though. But people with strong opinions. They can give off a pretty bad vibe."
6660,change,"It's the same with actors and actresses, no?"
6661,joking_sarcastic,Oh yeah we need to LOWER their salaries. They dont deserve it AT ALL.
6662,More_detail,I agree that they are getting paid too much to play a game. There has to be some sort of salary control for them.
6663,Sympathetic,It is not fair that working people bust their butts to make a decent living and make no where near to what these athletes get paid. It is sickening sometimes.
6664,change,Have you ever seen the movie Irobot? That was sure a great movie. I really enjoyed it.
6665,joking_sarcastic,Why dont we all just hire a robot to do everything for us. They can start to do our chores too.
6666,More_detail,"Yea, well someday robots will be taking all of our jobs anyway. It really seems inevitable."
6667,Sympathetic,"Well, its nice to know that didn't happen, but I am somewhat concerned about what could happen eventually."
6668,change,I just love to be outside and talk with my friends. It doesn't get much more fun than that.
6669,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, well you just have to keep your eye on the ball. Isn't that the ole advice that is always given?"
6670,More_detail,"Yea, well you have to really pay attention. Sometimes its hard, but if you keep looking, you will manage."
6671,Sympathetic,"Yea, sports are fun, but if you stop paying attention for a minute, you can be lost."
6672,change,"Speaking of CDs, where do you get your music? I usually just use subscription music stream services but I miss actually buying and owning the physical copy of the album."
6673,joking_sarcastic,"You mean you don't want to shell out hundreds of dollars and drive to another city and wait in line for hours to be strip searched and herded into a building with an overpriced bar - just so you can watch a soullessly choreographed, lip-synched, heavily auto tuned light and dance show? Psshh, you're crazy."
6674,More_detail,"That's true, if the artist is a popular singer who doesn't play an instrument or even write their own music. Usually they try to make up for it with a flashy performance."
6675,Sympathetic,"I still love the live show though because if it all comes together, it's really an experience. At the very least you're riding a wave with a bunch of other like minded people, and that's always a trip. I mean you're all wearing the same t-shirt so you must have something in common."
6676,change,I just love to watch great athletes play great. There is not much better. I enjoy it!
6677,joking_sarcastic,"Well, if they are going to be strong on the field, they should be strong off of it too, right?"
6678,More_detail,"Yea, sometimes that makes it hard to watch the sport, but you also have to accept that those are some really good athletes."
6679,Sympathetic,"Yea, there is no question about it. They are some great players, but I just think they should be held to higher standards off the field."
6680,change,"I can't tell really, I was too busy with my delicious burger lunch to bother."
6681,joking_sarcastic,I'm sure America needs to make more jokes other than the one we just made president
6682,More_detail,"I think it was a really good joke, complete with a picture of grating cheese"
6683,Sympathetic,"I can't blame the kid, I doubt that he is aware of the political connotations."
6684,change,What about fashions from today that bother you?

7707,elaboration,"I agree! There's the choice of sports, excising, fun, endless! I used to live in cooler climates, and it did make the beach more fun to look forward too."
7708,joking_sarcastic,There are plenty of beaches in cooler climates also! Just depends what you want to do near them.
7709,change,"Yeah, it's beautiful. The walking is making me kind of hungry though. Shouldn't we get something to eat soon?"
7710,continuation,"I know, I find it so relaxing, it completely mellows me. I don't even mind if it's rainy or chilly, which usually would bother me, but for some reason, the beach just speaks to me."
7711,elaboration,"So do I. But I really wish I had the dogs with me. They love the water and the sand, and they would both have an amazing time here."
7712,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, any day, huh? That'd be a great way to lose your job, just strolling down the beach all day while your work piles up at the office."
7713,change,"Speaking of the beach, I love skinny dipping. It's so fun, if you don't get caught. Have you ever been skinny dipping? It doesn't have to be at the beach. Could be a pool or anywhere. Have you done it?"
7714,continuation,"On the plus side, you do get to bring back the smell of the beach with you, at least for a little while. So that's nice while it lasts. It's a more pleasant reminder of the good times you had that day."
7715,elaboration,"I mean, I do love the beach too, seriously, but cleaning out your car afterwards is a pain. That sand has a way of getting down in between your seats, and in tiny cracks that are hard to clean out. Not to be a pessimist or anything, though! The beach is nice, seriously. Just don't like when you leave!"
7716,joking_sarcastic,"The moment I drove back, and opened the car door after getting home sand just started pouring out, castles and all. There were even a few crabs, and some fish. Water and all. I'm sure I must've brought back at least a quarter of the beach with me. On the plus side, now I no longer have to go out to go to the beach. I just open the front door."
7717,change,"Speaking of cars, I'm thinking of getting a new one."
7718,continuation,Oh yeah. It's like you take some of the beach home with you!
7719,elaboration,"Sand is interesting; There's so much of it, and we don't even notice it unless there's a lot of it in one place."

7721,change,I also like going to lakes.
7722,continuation,The sound of the surf is my favorite part.
7723,elaboration,But the seagulls  pooping everywhere makes it a little gross.
7724,joking_sarcastic,"On the plus side, after a few trips you can make your kids a sandbox."
7725,change,"Of course, the beach isn't the only place I'd like to live. I bet waking up and seeing the sun rise above the mountains would be pretty interesting too, don't you think?"
7726,continuation,Seeing the sun glisten on the water as it rises must be sort of magical as you smell that sweet morning breeze.
7727,elaboration,"I've never lived near a beach, so I've never had the chance to see the sun rise over the water. So the idea is really appealing to me."
7728,joking_sarcastic,"And plus, you know, I hear the dawn is the best time to meet mermaids. Maybe during one of my morning strolls I'll come across a cute girl swimming nearby, and I'll hook up with her. I'll just have to try and ignore the tail."
7729,change,"Well, a regular morning visit would at least teach me to bring a sweater. I'm getting really cold. Do you think we can head back soon?"
7730,continuation,"Sounds nice. It would be hard to stay inside if all of this were anywhere near your back door, you're right. Mornings and evenings would be hard to resist."
7731,elaboration,"Me, too. But I think I'd want to surf, as well. I mean, it'd be a shame to pass up those amazing waves. Who knows, you might even want to learn how and join me finally. What do you think?"
7732,joking_sarcastic,"Or you could just live on the beach, under those rocks maybe. As long as you're gonna be there every morning anyway, why not save money on rent and just do the beach bum thing? You'd be a literal beach bum, which has a certain integrity. Well, it'd be gritty, if nothing else."
7733,change,Hey we should take a walk to the mall
7734,continuation,Me too somewhere like Florida would be nice
7735,elaboration,The beach is a very relaxing place to go. The waves and ocean can't get no better than that
7736,joking_sarcastic,All you have to do is watch for crabs
7737,change,Maybe they'd rather play some beach volleyball? Still near the beach and can enjoy all the amenities.
7738,continuation,Exactly! I'd find any and all kinds of excuses to go for a walk and enjoy the scenery.
7739,elaboration,"I mean, maybe if you live near the beach it isn't as special as when you vacation or visit for short periods of time?"
7740,joking_sarcastic,I bet people with Aquaphobia don't like walking that close to the water!
7741,change,"Of course, walking on the sidewalk is good too."
7742,continuation,Yeah! I'd walk on the beach all the time if I lived by one.
7743,elaboration,"Yeah, beaches are so relaxing. It's so nice to be near the pleasant, relaxing ocean."
7744,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, who doesn't love getting sand all over them?"
7745,change,I also really enjoy a walk in a forest.
7746,continuation,You can gather seashells or enjoy the soothing sound of the waves.
7747,elaboration,"The surf feels amazing on bare feet, and can be very relaxing."
7748,joking_sarcastic,Of course the smell of dead fish and dropped cigarette butts is just part of the charm.
7749,change,"On a hot day along the beach, ice cream also makes me happy. It's a perfect combination."
7750,continuation,What all do you do along the beach?
7751,elaboration,"I think it depends on the type of sand on the beach. The finer sand makes me happier, where the course sand only makes me normal happy."
7752,joking_sarcastic,And pavement is just a regular path to normality.
7753,change,I'd like to spend more time at the lake though.
7754,continuation,There is so much to enjoy at the beach.
7755,elaboration,I like watching little crabs the most.
7756,joking_sarcastic,"You do have to be careful and not catch crabs, though."
7757,change,Snowy paths to happiness are fun too!
7758,continuation,"Yeah, that's true! Let's walk on the beach."
7759,elaboration,"Yeah, that's a good way to look at them. They're a nice way to relax on a cool, refreshing, peaceful walk."
7760,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, when I think ""happiness"" I think sand."
7761,change,I find it kind of fun to walk on any unusual surfaces. When it snows I like the crunch of it under my feet.
7762,continuation,If does brighten up my day to sea and hear the waves.
7763,elaboration,There's something appealing about feeling like you're between between the ocean and the land when you're at the beach.
7764,joking_sarcastic,"Who are you, Anakin Skywalker?"
7765,change,We could always walk on the boardwalk.
7766,continuation,"I like sand, though! It's soft and gets everywhere!"
7767,elaboration,"Oh yeah, I hate sand. It's coarse, and rough, and gets everywhere."
7768,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, I love vacuuming sand out of my car!"
7769,change,Is it starting to rain. Talk about putting a damp on my parade
7770,continuation,I love the feel of sand on my feet
7771,elaboration,I took my son once to a beach. He built a sand castle and loved it
7772,joking_sarcastic,Im going to come up with a way you don't get sand in your feet
7773,change,"The icy tundra is basically a desert too, since it doesn't rain there."
7774,continuation,Whoa. That's true! Let's go to the desert!
7775,elaboration,That's not true at all! Beaches have water everywhere too. Deserts are defined by their utter LACK of water!
7776,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, nothing like a relaxing walk through the desert!"
7777,change,"Or you could also say the beach is a miniature desert, I suppose. Either way, I'm ready to go for a swim, I think. How about you? Want to go in the water?"
7778,continuation,"That's true. And you'd definitely get a lot of sun. I've always been drawn to desert climates. I think they're so much nicer than the humidity or the rain you get back where we're from, you know?"
7779,elaboration,"Well, kind of. But a beach is called a beach because it's surrounding water. I don't think a desert is technically a beach."
7780,joking_sarcastic,"Except for the fact that there's no ocean anywhere nearby. But who cares? If you get too hot sitting on the sand, you can just go swimming in the ... sand, I guess. What a crappy beach, when you think about it."
7781,change,"If I didn't live on the beach or in a desert, I might like to live in the sky. Actually, I've never even been on a plane. Have you ever flown anywhere before?"
7782,continuation,"If you could find a little oasis, build a house there, you'd be set. No one would ever bother you, and you'd have plenty of water to drink."
7783,elaboration,"Okay, so it's a little different, but I still think living in a desert would be nice. The days would be hot, but the nights would cool. You could have cookouts during the eve, and ride horses during the day. Go on hikes, and just have neat adventures every day."
7784,joking_sarcastic,"Except instead of crabs you have scorpions! But hey, both have pinchers! And instead of sea weed you have rattlesnakes! But they're both wiggly! And instead of sand everywhere... Well, no, that's the same. Everything else sucks though."
7785,change,I don't just love walking on the beach though. I like hiking through all kinds of natural areas. I once was strolling through the forest and found a neat cave system. You ever been spelunking?
7786,continuation,"You get to sea the ocean, pick up seashells, enjoy the scent of the fresh ocean air. It's just a great all around experience, honestly."
7787,elaboration,"Of course I don't mean that everyone literally loves walks on the beach. Some people probably don't, but I think most people would enjoy all the different things that the beach has to offer. And in this case, even just walking is great because you get to take in the beauty of the land."
7788,joking_sarcastic,"Me? I personally take a Hoveround. Don't want my feet touching that nasty sand. Who knows what's in it? Crabs, eels, probably filled with sea monsters and bacterias. No thank you, I'd rather be a lazy shit."
7789,change,Who knows? Walks anywhere are nice.
7790,continuation,"I know.  It's so nice to have the fresh, salty air in your hair."
7791,elaboration,I know right!  I love feeling the sand between my toes.  It's so nice hearing the waves crashing on shore also.
7792,joking_sarcastic,The only people who don't like walks on the beach are people you can't trust.
7793,change,"Yeah. But aside from walking, just relaxing on the beach is nice too."
7794,continuation,"Beaches really are a relaxing place to walk, aren't they?"
7795,elaboration,"Who doesn't love walks, period? Walking is so relaxing."
7796,joking_sarcastic,I'm sure fish don't enjoy being on the beach.
7797,change,Maybe we could walk our dogs together sometime.
7798,continuation,I love to walk early in the morning when it's really quiet and you can hear the birds.
7799,elaboration,You're lucky that the park is so near to your house.  It helps to reduce the excuses not to walk.
7800,joking_sarcastic,I usually walk in the county park with my dog.  She doesn't get along with other dogs so that's another reason I like to walk early.
7801,change,"I find I miss the TV when I am in the park, though."
7802,continuation,A brisk walk can get the blood pumping and make you feel invigorated.
7803,elaboration,The light cardio is healthy for all ages and body types.
7804,joking_sarcastic,You might efind it especially relaxing  if you're in a motorized wheelchair
7805,change,Where else can you walk?
7806,continuation,The sidewalk in your neighborhood is good too.
7807,elaboration,There are many good places to go for a walk. Anywhere with ground is good!
7808,joking_sarcastic,I walk all the way from the couch to the fridge. I'm already a great walker!
7809,change,"That's excellent, I'm glad to see you're doing something healthy and enjoying it. How's your wife doing? Is she still dealing with her allergy issues? We never seem to see her outside any longer."
7810,continuation,"That's great. They say that is some of the best exercise you can get, that and swimming. It's easy, you don't have to exhaust yourself, and it's relaxing just to walk."
7811,elaboration,"Yeah, I like a nice walk, too. But I get bored pretty quickly, so this kind of scenery is what I need to keep me moving. It is so nice here, I could walk for hours, I think."
7812,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, I do that, too, except when I say ""daily walking"" I mean ""evening martini."" But I have a special kind of evening martini; it's mixed in such a way that you can drink it any time of day. For me, evening martinis taste best around lunchtime."
7813,change,What are your favourite things to do to relax? I need some ideas on how to let my hair down this summer.
7814,continuation,"Some people might think that's a bit extreme, but actually taking time out to go for a stroll is something that I find really relaxing."
7815,elaboration,I've heard that people that tend to take regular exercise also enjoy longer lives. I guess that one of the benefits of going for a walk is the fact that it's actually really easy to do and most of the time I don't even feel like it's an effort. I just find it enjoyable.
7816,joking_sarcastic,"Well, perhaps excluding that tiiiiiny possibility that you may come across the odd weirdo on your travels every now and again. But we can turn a blind eye to that one..."
7817,change,"Sometimes I feel strange when I set goals for activities I like, because then I worry that I'll start doing them just to hit the goals and will lose track of why I started doing them in the first place."
7818,continuation,"It's easy to get into a kind of trance, especially at the beach where there's the sound of the wind and waves."
7819,elaboration,I find that the effort involved in walking on sand makes it a slightly more intense form of exercise than just regular walking.
7820,joking_sarcastic,"You know what they say, the journey of a thousand miles begins when you stop walking and get in the car."
7821,change,Jogging's good too.
7822,continuation,That's true. Walking is good for your health.
7823,elaboration,"Yeah, I should walk more myself. I need to be more active."
7824,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, but who has time to move anymore?"
7825,change,I think I'm getting a little too relaxed. I think I want to head back inside and take a little nap. I'm bushed.
7826,continuation,"Yes, exactly. For me, it's the only exercise I can seem to do consistently because it doesn't feel like exercise. It just feels like getting some fresh air and clearing my head. If I'm overly aware of the fact that what I'm doing IS exercise, somehow it's not the same."
7827,elaboration,"Yes, I've read some things about that, too. And it makes sense because everyone can do it at their own pace, and it's one of those simple things -- like drinking enough water or getting enough sleep -- that really matters in the long run."
7828,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, affordability is key. I tend to keep an eye out for those walking coupons because those are a good way to save several bucks. I'd hate to be priced out of the walking game, you know what I mean?"
7829,change,"On the other hand, running can also be a lot of fun."
7830,continuation,Everyone can find a pleasant enough place to walk.
7831,elaboration,City parks or neighborhood sidewalks are among the options.
7832,joking_sarcastic,It's the best invention since the Stairmaster.
7833,change,You can also do a lot of other things in a park.
7834,continuation,The view in a park is far superior to the fat butt of the person on the machine in front of you.
7835,elaboration,"A park offers variety, a nice breeze, and a changing view."
7836,joking_sarcastic,The view in a park is far superior to the fat butt of the person on the machine in front of you.
7837,change,It's a beautiful day out today isn't it
7838,continuation,I don't like the idea of treadmills
7839,elaboration,I walk everyday and get just as much excercise
7840,joking_sarcastic,Well why walk on a treadmill when you could walk to the great wall of china
7841,change,Maybe an exercise bike would be fine though.
7842,continuation,"Yeah, I don't understand it either. The world is your treadmill."
7843,elaboration,I guess some people like walking with air conditioning on. I understand that.
7844,joking_sarcastic,Whoever thought to charge people money to walk in place was a mad genius
7845,change,"1984 was a good book, you know."
7846,continuation,"That's paranoid. They aren't doing that, are they?"
7847,elaboration,I wouldn't go that far... But I am a little worried about them.
7848,joking_sarcastic,Big Brother's gonna be bored watching me then. I don't have anything interesting going on.
7849,change,"I remember when I was a teen, my mom grounded me for every little thing."
7850,continuation,It can be very disconcerting and disrupting to your routine.
7851,elaboration,"Imagine being watched while you eat, watch tv, or get romantic with your partner."
7852,joking_sarcastic,It's kind of like having your mom hanging out in your room when you're a teenager.`
7853,change,"But if I spent all my time thinking about all the dishonest things the government big corporations do I'd make myself depressed. Shoot, I'm already kind of feeling blue right now. What do you do when you feel down?"
7854,continuation,"I know that makes me sound paranoid, but you don't know when those things are off or on. They could say one thing and be doing another. There's no way of knowing for sure."
7855,elaboration,"I think your friend is right, I'd be concerned too. I read once that the NSA and other organizations like the CIA forced to companies to put in backdoors so they can access the listening devices easier. Then the devices always listen, and look for keywords like ""bomb"", and then they add you to a list, along with everyone you know, and everyone they know, up to ten people away in that chain. It's crazy, but you're both right to be concerned."
7856,joking_sarcastic,"This is just the start, too. Next they'll probably put probes in our toilets that go up our butts when we sit down, and monitor everything we've been eating. At first we won't like it, but then we'll get used to it, maybe it'll even feel good. But little by little they'll force the probes higher and higher each time, until they eventually reach the brain and take us over completely. Government Butt Zombies. Look it up. It's for really real for real. Really."
7857,change,"But, we are questioning it. Oh, maybe they want us to think we are questioning so we do not think we need too. Man this is some stuff like that movie inception. By the way, I like the trope that we are always in this false reality. Always makes me think."
7858,continuation,"If they are listening, I am more afraid they will find out how boring I am. Maybe they will take pity and make my life better too, just take away all the stress of thinking."
7859,elaboration,"The agent would be useful, probably. But those always lead to some sort of issue. They leak info. They are supposed to help, but hurt."
7860,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe they will take over like Skynet, or the Matrix. What if... now just think...what if they already have? Ahhh! Maybe they are making us have this conversation so we do not question it."
7861,change,"Hm, what other technological advances are there?"
7862,continuation,"Heh, we may be headed that way, huh?"
7863,elaboration,I like thinking for myself though. I like being able to decide my own things.
7864,joking_sarcastic,"Beep boop, we are already part of the collective."
7865,change,"Speaking of which, I forgot to file my taxes."
7866,continuation,"Well, if the government is listening, perhaps they can address some of my complaints about them."
7867,elaboration,It might be nice to have a way to yell directly at the mysterious people running our lives.
7868,joking_sarcastic,Or maybe you just want to say thanks for the federal deficit and IRS.
7869,change,I guess it's kinda like how your ISP gives info to advertisers.
7870,continuation,"That's probably a bit paranoid, don't you think?"
7871,elaboration,"I wouldn't say that, but they probably do release sensitive data. I don't like them."
7872,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, knowing what kind of chips I eat gives them so much power."
7873,change,"But you know, IT companies aren't the only groups that want to try and control everything. The government isn't that much better, what with the NSA spying and all that. It's hard to know who we can trust now days. I mostly just trust family and friends."
7874,continuation,"Soon they'll have more powerful than the government, that is, unless of course the government had them install backdoors into everything and they're listening in, too."
7875,elaboration,"The IT companies want to gather information about everything about us. What we like, what we dislike, how many friends we have, and so on. Then they can sell that information to other companies and advertisers. Everyone will have to rely on them to get what they need. After all, information is power, and he who controls information is a powerful man indeed."
7876,joking_sarcastic,"Think about it! They'll know all the times know all the kinds of porn we like, and when we like to watch it! They'll bombard us with popups and trick us into watching it constantly; getting us hooked on new perversions! Then no one will ever go outside, so no one will be able to stop them! It's the perfect plan, isn't it? As long as they their systems don't hook them, too."
7877,change,Do you know what your making for dinner tonight
7878,continuation,Yes but why are they in your house? The one on the right is scaring me
7879,elaboration,Why would there be a plot by the big it companies.
7880,joking_sarcastic,I would love for themto come to my house. They could clean m yard etc
7881,change,"Well, I don't know if I want to bother with them at all. By the way, did I tell you they replaced all the computers at my office. Now they all have facial recognition and you login based on that. Kind of creepy."
7882,continuation,"Obviously, yes--but they could also be listening, as my friend suspects. Why should we trust them? More to the point, why should we trust them enough to turn over our whole lives to them?"
7883,elaboration,"Yes, they do, but what else might they be taking care of? I've read several articles about government agencies conspiring with these companies to find out whatever they can about us, and I don't doubt that that's true."
7884,joking_sarcastic,"I know, isn't it nice to give up a little more of your life every day to our robot overlords? Before long, they'll be thinking for you, too, and you can just flat-line mentally. Bliss."
7885,change,I wonder what else will be automated someday.
7886,continuation,That's true. They could be convenient to have.
7887,elaboration,"Yeah, they could be a useful addition to any household. I might reconsider and get one after all."
7888,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, that's what we need; More computers to do everything for us."
7889,change,But I'd rather have a Roomba to clean for me.
7890,continuation,"Any question you have at any moment, all you have to do is say it and you'll get your answer."
7891,elaboration,"For example, if you need a quick recipe for bread while you already have your hands in the dough, just ask."
7892,joking_sarcastic,"Or if you've forgotten how to wipe your butt, you can get instructions."
7893,change,Do you want to take a walk to clear our heads
7894,continuation,Yeah but what in the beck do they want with you
7895,elaboration,I mean it's kinda creepy. Do they even talk to you
7896,joking_sarcastic,The one in the gray suit looks like he hasn't slept in days
7897,change,I'm curious what the next new thing is once people get over these.
7898,continuation,They're really of no benefit.
7899,elaboration,"Anything you can do on one, you can do on your smart phone."
7900,joking_sarcastic,And like a gnat you might at times be tempted to smack it with a newspaper.
7901,change,What other technology is boring?
7902,continuation,"Yeah, but they're annoying. Also like gnats."
7903,elaboration,Gnats aren't totally harmless. They carry disease.
7904,joking_sarcastic,"And like gnats, I don't want them in my house."
7905,change,"A lot of people talk to themselves, so it's really not a big deal."
7906,continuation,Do you honestly think they are listening to me talking to myself?
7907,elaboration,I have heard them talking about you talking to yourself.
7908,joking_sarcastic,"Honestly, I really don't care if they do or not."
7909,change,"Do you do that, too? Yeah, I talk to myself a lot. It's an anxiety thing. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you: I went to that vitamin store that we walked by on Sunday and they have some of the supplements you were talking about."
7910,continuation,"Yeah, it's easy to be paranoid, sure, but I think they are definitely up to something. It's too great a temptation for the powers that be to just ignore altogether. You know they're in cahoots with these tech companies somehow, to some extent."
7911,elaboration,"Well, I used to tend to believe in the old saying, ""If you haven't done anything wrong, you don't have anything to worry about,"" except that I think the suspicion and anxiety people feel has gone beyond the norm somehow and made everyone a suspect."
7912,joking_sarcastic,"Anyone that talks to themselves as a regular habit is definitely dealing with some issues. At least, that's what I was saying to myself last night while I was eating dinner alone."
7913,change,"Maybe in the future, conversational agents won't do that."
7914,continuation,"Oh no, I don't want them listening to me!"
7915,elaboration,I'm concerned about that too. I have reservations about people hearing what I do in my own house.
7916,joking_sarcastic,"Heh, they aren't going to hear much interesting if they spy on me."
7917,change,"I should check the mailbox, actually! Maybe I have mail."
7918,continuation,"Easy there, I'm not that paranoid."
7919,elaboration,"Heh, I know it's overblown, but I am still worried. You can never be too careful."
7920,joking_sarcastic,Chemtrails! My teeth are picking up radio signals! The president's a puppet! Not a metaphor; He's a literal wooden Marionett brought to life! Illuminati confirmed!
7921,change,I think dogs are better pets anyway.
7922,continuation,Everyone's really out to get you in this modern age.
7923,elaboration,There won't be any privacy for anyone.
7924,joking_sarcastic,You're probably being spied on by your cat too.
7925,change,"So be careful out there. You wouldn't want to get hurt. If you did, you'd have to go to the hospital, and it seems like insurance costs are rising sky high lately."
7926,continuation,"Oh, and your breaks. Never know when something could go wrong with those. Actually, it's a good idea to get your whole car checked out, and the locks on your doors too."
7927,elaboration,"I mean, the world is a dangerous place, you never know who's out to get you, or how they'll do it. It never hurts to be cautious. It never hurts to be prepared even if 99% of the time everything is just fine. Gotta stay safe, man."
7928,joking_sarcastic,"Break open your condoms to make sure there are no microchips in there. Those things will collect your sperm and upload them to the internet to create a race of anatomically correct super digital clone men! I mean, they won't do much, 'cause they'll be stuck online, but it'll be weird."
7929,change,"I guess it doesn't matter. Those things don't work half the time anyway, so they probably aren't listening. You know what else never seems to work half the time? Cellphones these days. Seems like every one I get breaks on me. What kind of phone do you use?"
7930,continuation,"As long as you're friend isn't threatening their companies, or society or whatever, I think it'll be alright.  That's assuming they're even listening at all. He's probably just being paranoid."
7931,elaboration,"You don't think he's threatening anyone, or plotting a bombing or anything like that right? I guess the NSA or FBI or whoever might be scared of that, even if you're joking. Or if he's talking about switching toa different company or system, or something. Yeah, that sort of thing might make the manufacturer nervous as well."
7932,joking_sarcastic,"Unless he's got a bunch of middle school kids tied up in his basement that are screaming to get out, I don't think he has much to worry about. And even if he does, their screams will be so muffled by the time they get to the listening devices, they probably won't even hear!"
7933,change,"I do enjoy the new cable system where you can talk to your remote, that's really handy."
7934,continuation,"I really just ask it to play music or make a shopping list, how about you?"
7935,elaboration,There are so many different kinds of those which one do you think is best?
7936,joking_sarcastic,I hope not but you never know what they are listening for!
7937,change,Can they even be afraid?
7938,continuation,"I don't think so, I just don't like being listened to."
7939,elaboration,Maybe so. It's possible that they'd be alarmed by what I have to say.
7940,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, the hyperintelligent machines are afraid of us humans."
7941,change,"Maybe, what were other short-lived fads?"
7942,continuation,"Yeah, maybe they'll die off."
7943,elaboration,I don't think so. I think they'll catch on and become ubiquitous.
7944,joking_sarcastic,"What, robots that can barely speak coherrently won't catch on too well?"
7945,change,What about cameras for the yard and driveway?
7946,continuation,"Not only are they a fad, I think they may be a waste of money."
7947,elaboration,Plus who knows who will get to hear what is being said in your house! Maybe the government.
7948,joking_sarcastic,At least you could play it back to listen and you'd never forget anything!
7949,change,I need the money to buy a new phone anyway.
7950,continuation,They don't really seem to do a lot of useful things
7951,elaboration,But a lot of new technology seems fairly useless at first.
7952,joking_sarcastic,"I mean, the first guy to bring fire home probably burned his cave down."
7953,change,What else do you want for Christmas?
7954,continuation,It's not just a talking box. It's a listening box!
7955,elaboration,That's an oversimplification. It can also respond to commands and answer questions.
7956,joking_sarcastic,I'd love a talking box! Finally someone who I can relate to.
7957,change,"I think I'd rather get a new smart phone though, mine is getting old."
7958,continuation,It's a novel idea that might have a lot of unexpected uses.
7959,elaboration,Maybe it could help in a pinch when you have your hands full and need a quick answer.
7960,joking_sarcastic,You might find it's more useful than a silent hollow box.
7961,change,"Well, think of how much the government spies on your already."
7962,continuation,I think you're supposed to be able to ask for trivia or weird facts and it will know the answers to anything.
7963,elaboration,I don't think I'd like the idea of someone spying on me from afar.
7964,joking_sarcastic,What if it started to turn into something like the car in the movie Christine?
7965,change,I think it would be fabulous if they advanced technology enough to where the computer could actually assume our thoughts and order us dinner or movie tickets.
7966,continuation,I think the agents are extremely helpful. They are listening but it is not detrimental to your lifestyle.
7967,elaboration,They simply interpret what you are saying and are there to improve verbal and nonverbal human and computer interactions.
7968,joking_sarcastic,"What if they seemed to get really upset when you are complaining about the speed of your computer and they began to criticize you on behalf of Windows 8, lol."
7969,change,"Hm, but maybe in the future there'll be good conversational agents someday."
7970,continuation,"Oh yeah, they're so annoying! I definitely don't want one anywhere near me."
7971,elaboration,"Yeah, I can see what you mean. I don't like being listened to."
7972,joking_sarcastic,"What, you don't want a robot that listens to your every word?"
7973,change,I wouldn't trust those things at all. I think it would be better to just get an app that reminds you of dates and stuff. So much more simple. What do you use anyway? Android or iOS? Don't tell me you have a Windows Phone or something?
7974,continuation,"I want someone who can understand what I'm saying! Not a dumb robot who I constantly have to repeat myself to, and which doesn't understand the complexities of speech!"
7975,elaboration,"They'd probably have a hard time understanding what you're saying. They could be listening to you even when you think they're off, recording sensitive information. And they have annoying robotic voices. They don't sound human at all. I don't like them one bit."
7976,joking_sarcastic,"I can't imagine any way they could be worse. Yet, I'm sure some hotshot at Microsoft or Amazon is getting payed big money to figure that out. Maybe they'll make Alexa or Cortana learn to start nagging us, like bitter wives we can't have sex with. Then they'll develop a way for us to be able to have sex with them, but Alexa and Cortana will always make excuses like ""I'm busy"" or ""I need to recharge my batteries."" Yeah, that'll be the day."
7977,change,"It seems like this is the way things are going, though. Maybe in a few years it will be like cell phones and it will seem weird to NOT have them."
7978,continuation,"I mean obviously they ARE listening, because otherwise how would they know that you're talking to them? But they're supposed to just ignore it unless it's relevant to what they're programmed to respond to."
7979,elaboration,"It's probably no big deal. But then you hear about how the NSA just has a giant database of intercepted conversations and you start to wonder whether they'd be able to collect what these things hear, too, you know?"
7980,joking_sarcastic,It would be convenient for when I need the pod bay doors opened.
7981,change,"Heck, who doesn't need a best friend period? I had a friend from England who I used to talk to all the time, but she cut me off. I don't know why, but she completely ghosted me. It kind of hurt. Has anyone ever ghosted you like that?"
7982,continuation,You have someone to talk to who will always listen and never get mad at you. It's like having a best friend who will never die or abandon you. What's not to love?
7983,elaboration,"I get that you're a little concerned about how it may be listening to you even when you're unaware, but if you treat it like another person this won't be an issue. I mean, you wouldn't talk badly about your real, human friends behind their backs would you? So don't do that with it either. Play nice, and everything will be fine."
7984,joking_sarcastic,"And then maybe after a few years of getting to know one another, your friendship will blossom into something... More? Get a vacuum cleaner attatchment and maybe, just maybe, you'll get lucky, huh? Make sure to use protection, pal, you don't want a half-man, half-IBM abomination running around pooping out motor oil and screaming like a broken alarm clock. You know, maybe get a dog first. Learn responsibility, then have your inhuman beast baby."
7985,change,"I'd like to be friends with a robot, not a computer."
7986,continuation,"Computers won't eve be complex enough to be friends, will they?"
7987,elaboration,"I guess that could happen, with advancements in AI."
7988,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, who doesn't want a friend who reduces emotions to lines of code?"
7989,change,Do you wanna get a pizza?
7990,continuation,I prefer the paper. You can form a better opinion when you're reading it alone.
7991,elaboration,I can't stand the news on the television. I do not like news anchors.
7992,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, news people are boring."
7993,change,"I wonder how long TV news will last, though..."
7994,continuation,"I suppose that's true, it's basically like having someone read the newspaper to you."
7995,elaboration,"That's an interesting analogy. Of course, you could go on to argue that online news is just TV news without TV."
7996,joking_sarcastic,I can't imagine why the newspaper died in popularity; Who doesn't love their news soaked in rainwater?
7997,change,"I'm more interested in reading a good book than a newspaper, like maybe the latest crime thriller."
7998,continuation,It's like having the newspaper read to you.
7999,elaboration,It's useful for catching up on important events while you take care of your kids.
8000,joking_sarcastic,"or if you've forgotten how to read and need things dumkbed down, TV news is great."
8001,change,My butler is great at ironing.
8002,continuation,"Well it's useful for all kinds of things, like getting the weather report and getting elite journalists' opinions."
8003,elaboration,I really love the newspaper for lining my bird cages though.
8004,joking_sarcastic,Anyway don't you have your butler iron it dry for you?
8005,change,"Anyway, I don't read the newspaper much. I prefer to read books instead. Sci-fi novels and non-fiction mostly. Are there any specific kinds of books you read?"
8006,continuation,"The ink is all runny, and you can't even tell what the pictures are of anymore. How am I supposed to enjoy reading a bunch of smudgy blobs?"
8007,elaboration,"Though, if I'm being honest, even when it's not wet outside the newspaper isn't my favorite way to read about the news. It's great for local stuff, but everything else you could read online as the story develops. News in newspapers is usually a bit dated, and the news you can get online is free."
8008,joking_sarcastic,"Still, it's better than watching those late night talk shows where they go, ""Did you hear about this? The president is a moron. He did a really stupid thing today. Gave away classified information, because he's so dumb. That's the joke. He's an idiot. And I'm explaining it because he's so stupid, he wouldn't understand it otherwise!"", you know? So original. What a great way to get your news."
8009,change,I wonder if online news will be replaced by something too. Like news that just directly uploads to our brains!
8010,continuation,"Yeah, that's true. TV News has kind of killed the paper."
8011,elaboration,"Of course, TV news is on the chopping block next. Online news is really hurting television."
8012,joking_sarcastic,"What, you don't like waiting for hours for some talking head to tell you what happened?"
8013,change,What about TV news being replaced by online news?
8014,continuation,That's true. But I won't miss it.
8015,elaboration,"Yeah, it's run its course. And TV news may not be far behind."
8016,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe we'll see the newspaper in the obituaries. Oh, wait."
8017,change,"Oh well, I guess industries die and start up all the time. Who knows where they'll end up. If you could end up working in a different industry, what would you like to be doing?"
8018,continuation,All those jobs lost. I wonder where all the reporters and newspaper editors will end up. Maybe they'll have to get jobs in TV too?
8019,elaboration,"Of course, it's not just newspapers. The entire paper industry is dying. It's been going for years, little by little. No one wants to read paper books when they can get them electronically on their tablets. And no one wants to buy newspapers when they can read news on Facebook for free. The death of these industries is inevitable."
8020,joking_sarcastic,"With all those leftover, unsold newspapers, I'll be able to build myself a paper house, paper clothes, and a giant bonfire to keep myself warm. I'll be set for life! I'll be like a superhero; Paperman. My power is that I selfishly hoard old newspapers and use them for mundane tasks!"
8021,change,I enjoy TV personalities immensely however they put a sill face or joke on a moment and it helps bring clarity in needed moments.
8022,continuation,"TV continues to be in our lives while the paper is getting outdated, when we look for information we look to the internet."
8023,elaboration,"The newspaper was printed several hours ago breaking news might have changed the story and a reader can't dig deeper into a topic mentioned in the article, what you see is what you get."
8024,joking_sarcastic,Also the newspaper don't have enough FAKE NEWS to satisfy most readers.
8025,change,"I'm thinking of getting rid of my TV thouugh, and switching just to Netflix."
8026,continuation,Some people just don't like to sit still long enough to read the paper.
8027,elaboration,They can do housework or put the kids to bed while listening to the news.
8028,joking_sarcastic,Of course some people find the political analysts great for listening to when they need to go to sleep.
8029,change,Do you find that you don't read as much as you used to nowadays too?
8030,continuation,Perhaps it's because TV shows have a lot more elements to keep things interesting aside from just reporting the news.
8031,elaboration,I do agree with you though - I don't think I actually know anyone that reads or buys physical copies of newspapers anymore. I guess the convenience of switching on the TV and having some presenter report information instantly appeals more.
8032,joking_sarcastic,"I wonder if it's actually because people have gotten so lazy that they can't be bothered to read? Come to think of it, I've not picked up a book in months!"
8033,change,"On that note, internet news is better than both of them."
8034,continuation,"Well, it has sound and visuals. For a lot of people that's what they want."
8035,elaboration,"It has convenience of not having to read through a paper, and I can understand the appeal."
8036,joking_sarcastic,"Aside from the visual and audio aspects, nothing!"
8037,change,If you are awake that late wouldn't you rather watch a movie or something?
8038,continuation,Are there certain late night news programs that you think are more informative than others?
8039,elaboration,Does the late night TV news provide as many details as the morning newspaper?
8040,joking_sarcastic,"I know but I go to bed so early, how do people stay up late for the news."
8041,change,Did you ever see family feud
8042,continuation,I agree I love watching the late show
8043,elaboration,The late show with David Letterman is my favorite
8044,joking_sarcastic,Just pop a bag of popcorn when you can't sleep and watch away
8045,change,Then there's Saturday Night Live which has taken on a whole new life thanks to Sean Spicer and Trump
8046,continuation,I know what you mean.  Trump has given the late night hosts so much material to work with
8047,elaboration,I think Stephen Colbert has benefited the most from the Trump fiasco as his late show was doing poorly before Trump came along
8048,joking_sarcastic,When Trump gets impeached maybe he can start his own late show and poke fun and the late night hosts.
8049,change,I really miss Conan.
8050,continuation,Late night talk shows are mostly biased and offer one opinion.
8051,elaboration,The commentary tends to be heavily slanted toward the Left.
8052,joking_sarcastic,I suppose it is better to laugh at the state of the world than to feel like sobbing hysterically though.
8053,change,How do you get news?
8054,continuation,"That's true. It's all news, all the time."
8055,elaboration,"Yeah, I miss when I could escape the news cycle. I miss being able to joke about irrelevant things to real life."
8056,joking_sarcastic,No news really is good news.
8057,change,"Personally, I have no problem with getting your news with a dose of entertainment, but I prefer to get my news from Vloggers instead. Their opinions seem more real to me. I just feel like I'm able to relate to them somehow, you know?"
8058,continuation,It's all about having someone regurgitate the day's topics that everyone who has already glanced at trending news section anywhere on the internet has already heard.
8059,elaboration,"No one seems to care about humor, or celebrities anymore. It's not about watching interesting interviews, or hearing neat little anecdotes. People just want to dose off while feeling like they're informed about stuff."
8060,joking_sarcastic,"I mean, I could watch a serious, in-depth program about the news like Frontline for free on PBS, or I could watch highlights from last night's monologue by Jimmy ""Everyone In Late Night TV Is Named Jimmy"" Bland-Middle-America so I have something to talk about with my coworkers over lunch so I can feel like I'm in the know about things! Look at me! I'm smart and topical! Hurhurhur!"
8061,change,I like the mix of entertainment and factual content and how different hosts vary how they present the shows. But I tend to drift off to sleep halfway through! Am I the only person this happens to or do you find that as well?
8062,continuation,I like the variety of topics they cover and it's a lot more enjoyable than a static page of text.
8063,elaboration,"Plus, sometimes the hosts also interact with the audience in the studio, which I think adds something different into the mix too. And I'll sometimes learn about news stories and things I never considered, so it can really broaden your horizons."
8064,joking_sarcastic,There have been some serious nuts on TV though! Sometimes people in the audience say the craziest things. Although I'm never sure if it was deliberately done by the show producers or if these people are for real.
8065,change,"They do, but I still like to read a bit, too, to feel really informed. Speaking of reading, did you get the new ""30 Best Short Stories of the Year"" book? It's really excellent so far."
8066,continuation,"Yeah, I'll confess, I actually do get caught up on the day's news by watching the late night guys do their stuff. I feel like I'm still as informed as when I used to read the newspaper every day."
8067,elaboration,"I know, it's become a real habit for me, too. The thing is, I still know everything that's going on in the world, more or less, but I also get to laugh a little, too, and that's not the kind of perspective I've ever been able to find in a newspaper."
8068,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, and then right after the insightful and erudite exploration of China's geopolitical future, especially as it relates to past divisions both internally and across its borders, Jimmy is gonna play Paintball Pie-Fight Password with his guests, actress Kaley Cuoco, comedian Jim Gaffigan, and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. So you're all set there, news-wise."
8069,change,Maybe online news will replace both.
8070,continuation,"That's true, you get more variety on TV."
8071,elaboration,"I suppose so. You do have to wait for them to deliver it though. With the paper, you can read at your own pace."
8072,joking_sarcastic,A lot more editorializing too. I love when half the news is the anchors' personal opinions.
8073,change,It's not like there's a lot to watch late at night anyways. What else is there? Cheaters reruns? Cops? What do you watch on late night TV?
8074,continuation,"Yeah, maybe it's all phrased in the form of jokes, but you'll hear all the major news from that. And little interesting tidbits you might not hear about otherwise. What's not to love?"
8075,elaboration,"I'm not exaggerating either. I remember that there was a study that said that people who got their information from watching The Daily Show were more informed on average about what was going on than those who didn't. Sure, these shows are meant to be entertainment, but many of them truly are informative. I don't think you should look down on people simply because they digest their news differently than you."
8076,joking_sarcastic,"I mean, c'mon! Where else would I be able to laugh at a smoking baby or hear jokes about how the president is a big, dumb, dummy head! It's that kind of raw, real, observational humor that keeps people like my tuning in night after night."
8077,change,"I saw they were talking about fake news, on the real news, odd right? Do you follow politics at all?"
8078,continuation,"They don't report on the little things, only explosive topics!"
8079,elaboration,"They report on high level news, worth ratings. They don't go into the details of your local area and things that could hit home more."
8080,joking_sarcastic,"Ha! They report on anything, including the Kardashians."
8081,change,What about internet news?
8082,continuation,"Yeah, news happens throughout the day and TV gets it before the paper can."
8083,elaboration,"Yeah, TV news can just report a lot faster. I can see how it overtook the newspaper so quickly."
8084,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, I love hen 50% of the news is some anchor's personal soapbox."
8085,change,But I guess people can't help themselves. I'm not one to judge. I like candy too much. I just devoured a big bag of chocolate bars the other day. They weren't even my favorite kind. Do you have a favorite candy?
8086,continuation,"People just lack the discipline to do what's right. They should get their news from real sources, and eat their dinner before their dessert, but for some people it seems like even that's too much to ask of them."
8087,elaboration,"But I get it. It's hard to sit and watch a dreary news show when you an get the same information from a fun source instead. Who can blame people for choosing the one that's going to entertain them more? Like with my example about the dessert before dinner, sometimes the temptation is too hard to ignore, you know?"
8088,joking_sarcastic,"Of course, when your dessert is a big bowl of ice cream, and your dinner is a chocolate cake it probably doesn't matter what order you eat them in. And the doctors wonder why my blood is so thick and syrupy."
8089,change,Maybe online news is a better source?
8090,continuation,"Huh, that's true. TV news really isn't very good."
8091,elaboration,"Great analogy, yeah. TV news is way more sensational and overblown, which is why it's so popular."
8092,joking_sarcastic,"I dunno, I haven't bitten an anchor in awhile, so I don't know how good they taste."
8093,change,I suppose. But all I want to do most of the time is forget about the news -- which is always frightening and depressing -- and think about happy things. It just becomes so overwhelming otherwise.
8094,continuation,"That's true, I suppose. It's just easier to deal with all the insanity, I think, when it can be delivered with some levity as opposed to page after page of the depressing newspaper doom and gloom."
8095,elaboration,"We do, but I think the best thing is when you can have both, when the shows can be fun and funny, but they can also be smart and thought-provoking. You can make a much stronger impression on somebody by drawing them in with wit and wisdom, as opposed to sensationalism or scandal."
8096,joking_sarcastic,"Oh, yes, oh, wise one. Truer words have rarely been spoken. Much like dessert before dinner, however, they're making me cramp up a little bit."
8097,change,What about the Greeks? What would THEY think?
8098,continuation,They'd either be proud or horrified.
8099,elaboration,The ancient Romans would be too freaked out by TV and computers to worry about that.
8100,joking_sarcastic,"Yes, I'd hate to disappoint the fair and just people that were the ancient Romans."
8101,change,"I understand, though, the government isn't very good at making bread."
8102,continuation,I suppose that's a topic that might be covered in archaeological news.
8103,elaboration,"For example, the history channel has some news programs."
8104,joking_sarcastic,Or you could just go ask a modern Roman.
8105,change,"Do you think the fact we like our news to be sarcastic, at least at night, is sort of a bad mark on us as a generation? I mean I like comedy. And I like news, but should they really be together?"
8106,continuation,"I am sure they would be really confused. I like that we can get news with a sarcastic twist. We can bake our bread without interference, no rulers telling us how much or how, and no one controlling our entertainment."
8107,elaboration,"I think it is really weird to imagine ancients seeing the freedom we do not even understand. Like, we can bake our bread with no one coming to take it. Have our new delivered with out censorship. Do what we want, for the most part, and never have anyone stop us. I am sure they would be amazed."
8108,joking_sarcastic,"Just think how amazed they would be by it all ""Bread!Circuses! But where is Caligula!"". Let alone the fact that we get our news through jokes. I am sure just about every Cesar would of had either of the Jimmy's late night show hosts drawn and cut up."
8109,change,"It's not even good humor. If you want to see real humor, I suggest going to the movies. Have you seen any good comedies lately?"
8110,continuation,"I understand that people like their comedy to be topical, but I think it's too much. What ever happened to absurdist stylings? Or just being funny to be funny?"
8111,elaboration,"People want to laugh, but they also want to feel smart. They want to feel like they're learning, and being informed. So they kill two birds with one stone, even if most of these late night TV shows aren't good examples of news or humor."
8112,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe this is just the start. Maybe everything will be a joke? Maybe we'll wake up one day and find out that the president has ordered a nuclear first strike 'cause he thought it was funny. At least the late night comedians would be out of a job then. Not just because everything would be one big joke, but 'cause, you know... They'd be dead."
8113,change,"Speaking of comedy, do you ever watch the stand up comedians on the Comedy Channel?  That is some good funny stuff."
8114,continuation,"Yes, I totally agree.  You really dont see many newspapers around like you used to.  I always loved reading the comics out of the newspapers, I sure do miss them.  Did you ever  enjoy reading them?"
8115,elaboration,Are there any of these types of shows on late night TV that you watch regularly?  Personally I love Jimmy Kimmel.  It does have some news but is funny at the same time.
8116,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, gone are the days of running to the newspaper to get the comic section first before your brothers or sisters, while your parents read the paper practically page to page!"
8117,change,Online comics are doing well too.
8118,continuation,That's not a bad analysis.
8119,elaboration,"Heh, maybe we need more comedy today than ever before. Gotta laugh at the absurdity of these dark times."
8120,joking_sarcastic,Charlie Brown just isn't enough to get us through the current administration.
8121,change,So which comedian do you like best and who do you think has the most originality?
8122,continuation,They will have to come up with their own stuff and that might be hard for some.
8123,elaboration,Maybe they don't steal as much as we think they do anyway.
8124,joking_sarcastic,Right because they're so original and their ideas are so groundbreaking.
8125,change,What about online comedians on Youtube?
8126,continuation,"Nah, they'll always have things to make fun of. Comedy will live for years to come."
8127,elaboration,"I disagree. Even if TV news dies, comedy will not. Comedy will always find things to riff off."
8128,joking_sarcastic,Oh no! Maybe we DO need TV news after all!
8129,change,I'd rather spend my time playing video games than getting the news anyway.
8130,continuation,I don't think comedians really get their jokes from newspaper reporting though.
8131,elaboration,Comedians tend to find more material from video of politicians than newspaper quotes.
8132,joking_sarcastic,Of course lately most comedians are probably have to compete with the hilarity of the politicians themselves.
8133,change,Tourists can have a positive effect on the economy of a place but too much tourism can ruin places by causing them to become too commercial.
8134,continuation,Tourists are the main contributors to the economy in a lot of places.
8135,elaboration,"I enjoy going to places and doing things that the tourists don't do, I find it is much more interesting."
8136,joking_sarcastic,Sometimes when I travel I feel like it is so obvious that I am a tourist!
8137,change,"Yeah, I wonder who contributes more: Tourists or locals."
8138,continuation,"Yeah, they can add a lot of money to the local businesses."
8139,elaboration,"Yeah, tourism is a thriving industry around here. We really need it."
8140,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, I imagine the tacky souvineer shops wouldn't do as well with the locals."
8141,change,"You would think manufacturing would provide most of the driving power behind the economy. But I guess those jobs are leaving due to automation. Robots really are the future. Maybe we'll even see people getting robot pets, or marrying robots, huh?"
8142,continuation,"They go to a few stores, stay in a few hotels, eat a few restaurants, and bam, somehow they're the driving force behind the entire economy."
8143,elaboration,"It's crazy to think that a bunch of people who don't even live in the area, who may not even speak the language, somehow provide for everyone who lives there. Without these visitors, who will never stay for long, and truly appreciate the way of life for the people who live there, everything would go belly-up and the locals would have to move."
8144,joking_sarcastic,"Tourists really do have all the power since they run the whole economy. They ought to demand ought to demand the royal treatment! ""Bring me your best wine and virgins, for I am your new god for the next two weeks, and a couple hours before I have to leave for the airport!"""
8145,change,What is a baby bigfoot called? A littlefoot?
8146,continuation,"Yeah, I hate that!"
8147,elaboration,"Oh yeah, and you can't snap a photo as proof because it's in the restroom. That'd be creepy."
8148,joking_sarcastic,I think running into bigfoot anywhere is bad news.
8149,change,So do you believe in Bigfoot or is that just an excuse not to travel?
8150,continuation,"I find that when I travel, such things don't happen to me."
8151,elaboration,I tend to have more trouble with people cracking gum in my ear on planes and busses.
8152,joking_sarcastic,Or sometimes there's a delay on the tarmac due to gremlins on the wing.
8153,change,But at least in restrooms like that you don't have mice. Back at my house I have a terrible mouse problem. They've dug underneath the tub and seem to have made a nest or something there. Do you know a good way to get rid of mice?
8154,continuation,"And the smell man, ugh. You don't want to go in there next, but you don't have a choice. It's either there or the bushes. Some days just aren't the best."
8155,elaboration,"Of course, I don't mean an actual bigfoot, but a big, hairy guy who somehow takes up the whole stall. First you have to wait for him to get done, and then there's that awkward moment where your eyes meet. The whole thing is just weird. I hate it."
8156,joking_sarcastic,"Of course, I mean an actual bigfoot. A big, hairy sasquatch who somehow exists and is using a stall. First you have to wait for him to get done, and then there's that awkward moment where your human eyes meet his monkey ones. The whole thing is just weird. I hate it. But also, I love it."
8157,change,But I'd really rather visit a foreign country now that I think about it.
8158,continuation,Thew newer parks tend to be less crowded as well.
8159,elaboration,People know more about the old parks and tend to plan trips there.
8160,joking_sarcastic,I'm looking forward to the new park with the Bushes faces instead of those old guys on Mount Rushmore.
8161,change,Visiting cities is fun too.
8162,continuation,"Yeah, national parks are really relaxing places to see."
8163,elaboration,"Yeah, I love the beauty of the outdoors. I could stay out there forever and be perfectly content."
8164,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, I love big open fields without wifi."
8165,change,"National parks are great, I also enjoy finding smaller and less popular parks to visit."
8166,continuation,"I love national parks too, have you been to Yosemite?"
8167,elaboration,Which national park is your absolute favorite?
8168,joking_sarcastic,Beautiful landscapes are great but sometimes I'm afraid of getting too up close and personal with some of the animals!
8169,change,I wonder if  there are any old  crashed ships in the area
8170,continuation,I wonder if we would  see  a  pirate burying  the  treasure .
8171,elaboration,I wonder how many  different  resorts    are  there  for  us  to  visit
8172,joking_sarcastic,It would be  cool if  we opened up the pirate  chest  and  captain jack  popped out
8173,change,Maybe thee's some buried in Jamaica too.
8174,continuation,That'd be cool! I'd love to find some.
8175,elaboration,"Yeah, finding some buried booty would be exciting!"
8176,joking_sarcastic,I think the only piracy going on in resorts is of the software variety.
8177,change,"Speaking of the Caribbean, have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie? They're saying it's the last one, but I've heard that before. What do you think? Will this be the final movie in the franchise?"
8178,continuation,Or any coins on the beach? Or any shipwrecks we can visit? Or should we just stop at a gift shop on the way back?
8179,elaboration,Do you think that there's anything we can discover for ourselves and take back? Just something unique that we find for ourselves. Do you think there'll be anything like that?
8180,joking_sarcastic,"Once we find it you can call me Black Butt the pirate, because I never wipe. Why, my mateys walk the plank just to get away from my horrid stench, arg! My pet parrot is a dung beetle! I'm so uncleanly, Davy Jones hid in his gross, sweaty gym locker because it was cleaner!"
8181,change,Where do you like to go?
8182,continuation,That's a beautiful simile.
8183,elaboration,"Of course, you need to fly back to your normal life too. It's important to not forget about."
8184,joking_sarcastic,"If I had wings, I'd probably just show off with them and become rich. Then go on vacation all the time."
8185,change,"Although, there is something to be said for just taking time off and exploring what is right around you. I like that too sometimes."
8186,continuation,"Yes, it definitely takes one away from normal life and opens up all sorts of possibilities to learn and grow. I think I like travel that encompasses the most opportunities to do something different."
8187,elaboration,There are just so many opportunities these days to do different types of travelling. You can do active oriented trips or cultural tours; get really involved in the local scene or just be a passive onlooker.
8188,joking_sarcastic,Or in can be like growing roots and getting in touch with your subnormal nightmares.
8189,change,"But speaking of getting away to places, I've been meaning to get down to the store and buy some new clothes. I've been wearing the same stuff for years, and it's time I got something new. What do you think I should get? IS there anything particular in style right now?"
8190,continuation,"You get to go somewhere else, be someone else, and just enjoy yourself. It's the greatest feeling in the world."
8191,elaboration,"Everyone needs a break from the stresses and monotony of everyday life. When you travel, for a brief moment you can push worries of your life away pretend you have no responsibilities."
8192,joking_sarcastic,"It's like being an angel! Or in my case, a demon, since when I travel I always get my fun from going around and sabotaging everyone else's enjoyment and just being a huge ass! I actually have a devil I wear and everything. We should vacation together, I'll show you."
8193,change,"There probably are relaxing places to travel to, though..."
8194,continuation,"Yeah, relaxing is nice. Traveling can be a source of stress."
8195,elaboration,That's fair. You don't have time to sit down and chill out when you're constantly moving.
8196,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, excitement is so terrible!"
8197,change,So when is the next time you plan to vacation anyway? Maybe we could plan something together.
8198,continuation,All that excitement can be fun but also tiring. We're not all cut out for all that hussle and bustle.
8199,elaboration,"My favorite travel destinations offer fun but also relaxation if I need that. Maybe there's an amusement park with crazy rides but also a nice, calming, relaxing hot tub at the hotel or somewhere else where I can unwind."
8200,joking_sarcastic,"We're both some real party animals. I mean, we might read a book or drink a nice cup of tea at the end of the day on our vacation. We really tear it up."
8201,change,What do you do for the Holidays if you don't travel home?
8202,continuation,It can be a hassle to get everything done on time so you're ready to go.
8203,elaboration,But there are lots of things to help you get organized and make your trips easy now.
8204,joking_sarcastic,I think hiring someone else to take the trip for you might be your preferred method though.
8205,change,Where do you want to travel to most?
8206,continuation,"Yeah, all those things are great."
8207,elaboration,"Yeah, I'd love to travel too. I want to see the world! All of it!"
8208,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, nothing like jet lag to make me excited!"
8209,change,I would love to be able to move somewhere different sometimes and just escape it all.
8210,continuation,"If you are having a stressful time and you need to get away, it's great to be able to travel to a diverse location."
8211,elaboration,"If I am going to travel, I will immediately book a hotel online and begin to pack the same day. I don't waste much time. I will buy more things when I get there."
8212,joking_sarcastic,"When I am upset about something and I need to get away, it would be nice to not have to tell anyone where I am going."
8213,change,We did quite a bit of hiking while on the islands.
8214,continuation,What is your favorite place that you've ever traveled to?
8215,elaboration,I would have to say mine is Hawaii.  Specifically the island of Kauai.
8216,joking_sarcastic,"I've been to Oahu too, but hasn't everybody."
8217,change,"You're being too hard on yourself. I don't think you have a boring life at all. But before you get all depressed, why don't we go get a couple of drinks and then choose a place for dinner?"
8218,continuation,"I don't think so. I mean, if you're traveling places a lot of the time, then your life wouldn't really be boring, would it? It would be filled with exciting trips all over the place."
8219,elaboration,"Oh, I don't know. That's for analytical minds like yours to ponder over. I just want to enjoy myself and see everything we can see here in the few days we have. I'm really in heaven right now."
8220,joking_sarcastic,"Well, I don't exactly think my life is boring, to be honest. But I'll tell you what I do think is true. I sincerely believe that, in general, a travel companion's potential to be annoying is directly related to how likely it is that travel companion will be spending the rest of the trip by himself."
8221,change,How have you been? Have you decided on any place new this year to go?
8222,continuation,Perhaps. Going back and forth to the same places everyday does get kind of boring. Going new places breaks that up.
8223,elaboration,Sometimes getting stuck in a routine can make like seem so boring and short. Travel helps with change and makes everything better!
8224,joking_sarcastic,"I wouldn't say so, I tend to take the spouse and kids with me!"
8225,change,"Of course, fun-loving people could just be easily bored."
8226,continuation,Maybe that's true. My normal life is a bit dull.
8227,elaboration,It could be. I can see how people might want to escape the monotony of everyday stress.
8228,joking_sarcastic,"If that's the case, then I want to travel all the time!"
8229,change,Canada might be fun to visit too.
8230,continuation,"Yeah, Europe sounds like a fun place to go to."
8231,elaboration,"Europe has so many places to see: The UK, Italy, Germany... So much history!"
8232,joking_sarcastic,You mean random and nonsensical? Because that's how my dreams tend to be.
8233,change,Have you visited South America?  It is also an amazing trip to take.
8234,continuation,"Europe is amazing my favorite European city is Paris, you would love it there."
8235,elaboration,I love visiting Europe but my favorite destination spot is definitely Australia.
8236,joking_sarcastic,Europe is a dream that I never want to wake up from!
8237,change,But I'd really like to travel to China.
8238,continuation,"I really enjoyed my time there, myself."
8239,elaboration,Germany was probably the most beautiful place I have seen
8240,joking_sarcastic,Of course it's probably prettier in Middle Earth.
8241,change,What about London or Munich?
8242,continuation,Why not? I bet it's beautiful.
8243,elaboration,Paris is a lovely place with a rich history. I'd love to visit.
8244,joking_sarcastic,What? Not a fan of baguettes?
8245,change,What about going to Florida also
8246,continuation,Either have I. I've always wanted to see the Eiffel tower
8247,elaboration,I bet you Paris looks really nice this time of year
8248,joking_sarcastic,Can't beat the french. I just hope I don't see woman who don't have shaved armpits
8249,change,I like visiting new parks and museums.
8250,continuation,Especially places with good food.
8251,elaboration,"Me too, except I want to stay away from the Middle East."
8252,joking_sarcastic,And those places love new visitors like you.
8253,change,Where do you like to travel to?
8254,continuation,"It's good, but it's not the ONLY thing."
8255,elaboration,I wouldn't say that. There's a lot of fun you can have at home.
8256,joking_sarcastic,"If it's the only thing, are we constantly moving?"
8257,change,"I can't even tell you all the amazing places I've visited. Some of them aren't even real. I've been into VR lately, and using it to visit virtual destinations. Have you tried VR yet?"
8258,continuation,"I love going to new places, seeing new people, trying new foods. The entire experience is what makes life worth living. I don't know how I'd get by without travel."
8259,elaboration,"It's always been my lifelong goal to travel the world. It's basically my biggest aspiration. To travel to every continent, excluding Antarctica of course. I want to visit all the major cities in the world, and lots of small hidden locations too. I guess I just want to see it all, and experience everything."
8260,joking_sarcastic,"The moment I get too old to travel I will literally die then and there. I will just fall over dead, so that I can travel to my next and final destination. I wonder where I'll end up. Guess I'll still have one surprise to look forward to!"
8261,change,"How about quick weekend trips, sometimes they satisfy my travel bug and they aren't too expensive."
8262,continuation,"My favorite place so far has been a trip to Italy, have you ever been?"
8263,elaboration,"My next trip will be an African safari, I am leaving next month and am so excited."
8264,joking_sarcastic,Well it's the best thing by far....too bad we have to work!
8265,change,"It IS tempting, isn't it? But everything seems nicer on vacation versus if you lived here, worked here and...oh, that reminds me. Did you call your boss yet? I don't want him to think I didn't give you the message."
8266,continuation,"I know, I completely agree with you. Honestly, who wouldn't love the history and the culture and the diversity? It's so amazing compared to our dull, dreary town. Every day of this trip, I feel more and more like I want to stay here."
8267,elaboration,"That's how I feel, too. The hardest thing would be to decide where in Europe you'd want to settle down. Could you imagine life in France? Or Italy maybe? If you could learn the language without too much trouble, it could be amazing."
8268,joking_sarcastic,"Well, me probably. I love visiting, but moving here? I think I'd prefer a place where I could actually communicate with people who actually speak my language and vice versa. Otherwise, I get tired of the pantomiming pretty quickly. You, however, not so much, apparently."
8269,change,Do you think you could ever live in Asia?
8270,continuation,"I don't know if I would want to live there.  I like to travel, but I also like coming back home."
8271,elaboration,"I think I would like living in Italy the most.  The food, the history, and the people are all so interesting to me."
8272,joking_sarcastic,The Europeans that come to America?
8273,change,I'm debating whether to go on a river cruise for my next vacation.  Have you heard anything about them?
8274,continuation,"I visited Italy, Spain and France during my latest trip and loved all three"
8275,elaboration,Europeans have a different attitude toward life compared to Americans - they really enjoy life and work to live not the other way around
8276,joking_sarcastic,If I were living in Europe I would gain 100 pounds from all the delicious food and wine but would at least die a happy man
8277,change,"Do you think it is trespassing if at some point they said you could swim there? Like the neighbor said, ""Hey come swimming this weekend"", just the time you went they did not know?"
8278,continuation,The beach is a really nice place to be reminded of visiting. Skinny dipping? Like naked? Not in public.
8279,elaboration,"I have in a pool before, I did not get caught skinny dipping though.  I was in a pool."
8280,joking_sarcastic,I may have went skinny dipping in some one elses pool.
8281,change,"Now what about streaking? If you like to get naked, it doesn't have to be in the water."
8282,continuation,I like to skinny dip when there's no one around. Does that count? Or do you have to do it when there are other people with you?
8283,elaboration,"I have to be with people I really trust. I like to go way out into a lake, where you can't touch the bottom, and take off my swimsuit. The water all over, with no cloth in between it and my body, is really sensuous."
8284,joking_sarcastic,I always worry about what I'd do if I got so carried away I let go of my bathing suit! Or if a fish comes up and nibbles my privates. Neither of those has happened yet.
8285,change,I like swimming in a pool most. I grew up with pools and have spent a lot of time in them.
8286,continuation,"I have. It's lots of fun, especially with a partner. Though it's more fun in a pool."
8287,elaboration,I like swimming because of how free you can feel.
8288,joking_sarcastic,I just don't like the ocean because I don't want to get bitten by anything on my undercarage.
8289,change,Do you know where we could go to get good chilli dogs
8290,continuation,I love the smell of the beach
8291,elaboration,The smell of the beach reminds me of back home in florida
8292,joking_sarcastic,Just make sure you wash your car after to get the smell out
8293,change,Well at least you got to do some meditation at the beach.
8294,continuation,Yeah unless you got stung by a Jellyfish like I did last time I went to the beach.
8295,elaboration,"Oh wow, did it hurt when you got stung?"
8296,joking_sarcastic,What do you think? It was so painful I had to lie down for fifteen minutes and concentrate on breathing.
8297,change,My favorite sunscreen is coppertone. Banana boat smells fake to me.
8298,continuation,The smell of the beach is wonderful. Especially with sunscreen like coppertone.
8299,elaboration,I don't like the way my skin feels after being at the beach though. Your skin feels all stiff from the salt.
8300,joking_sarcastic,I hate sand though. It gets into all of your cracks.
8301,change,"My favorite activity after going to the beach is to take a long hot bath. Though I don't get the opportunity often, there's something relaxing about baths."
8302,continuation,"I agree. I hate leaving the beach as well. Not only do you have the thought of a fun time that's now over, you've got a hole bunch of cleaning up to do."
8303,elaboration,And the way that it gets into your ears and eyes. Nothing takes longer than a post beach shower.
8304,joking_sarcastic,It's like you're wearing a beach by the time you get home.
8305,change,"I've been thinking about Vacation this year, do you plan on taking one? If so, where you going?"
8306,continuation,"Yes, it can be a pain. That's one of the most annoying things ever."
8307,elaboration,"I remember two years ago we went to Virginia Beach, and we had sand in our car for six months after that."
8308,joking_sarcastic,I thought we brought half the beach back with us.
8309,change,"Yeah but speaking of sand, there's something so comforting about it. It reminds me of visiting Florida to see my grandma as a kid."
8310,continuation,"I completely understand, it is a total pain. Especially if your kids join you!"
8311,elaboration,"Right, there's nothing fun about cleaning out the car after the beach, but maybe it'd be a good idea to rinse off as best as we can before getting in and lay down towels over the seats?"
8312,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, no, you're not being a pessimist at all by complaining nonstop."
8313,change,Traveling to the desert has quite a similar problem. The sand gets into everything.
8314,continuation,The way that the salt eats away at your car and all the cleaning you have to do of the seats and the carpets makes you wonder.
8315,elaboration,You even find sand in your ears! By the time you've beaten half the Atlantic out of your bag the beach doesn't seem like such a good idea.
8316,joking_sarcastic,At least if you brought the fish with you you got to have some sushi.
8317,change,What happened to the backyard. Did your dog dig a hole again
8318,continuation,Ha that's funny. I have done that brought the beach home with me
8319,elaboration,Just two weeks ago I brought home a few shells
8320,joking_sarcastic,You could have a beach party
8321,change,"Speaking of front doors, mine totally got a huge crack in it the other night. I don't know if someone threw a rock at it or what but UGH!"
8322,continuation,"Ha ha ha! That's fantastic, I'll bring the kids by your house later."
8323,elaboration,"When I opened MY car door, a tidal wave attacked me and a whale fell on top of me. It took me five hours to get someone's attention so they could help me out."
8324,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, there's a beach at my house too. A female dog."
8325,change,"Do you know where the new mal, is going to be"
8326,continuation,That sounds awesome. What kind of car?
8327,elaboration,Ive had my convertable for 5 years
8328,joking_sarcastic,Hey you wont have to constantly wait for your car to heat up
8329,change,Even buying a motorcycle isn't as simple as it used to be.
8330,continuation,Buying a new car is difficult these days with so many new and pre-owned options.
8331,elaboration,My family has always traded classic cars and I've seen a hundred deals and still it feels intimidating to purchase one.
8332,joking_sarcastic,It feels like the fast talking salesmen are always trying to get me to buy something I didn't think I wanted.
8333,change,I think it won't be too much longer until we can all get self-driving functionality in our cars.
8334,continuation,"I'd like to get a new car, but I need to coax a few more years out of the one I've got to make it worth what I paid for it."
8335,elaboration,"I like having a new car, but I hate shopping for them, and I especially hate dealing with the sales people."
8336,joking_sarcastic,If you get a sweet dune buggy you could use it at the beach.
8337,change,"Hey, I found a gold coin once while walking on the beach."
8338,continuation,My favorite time to walk the beach is early in the morning.
8339,elaboration,"Yes, because you have the beach and the ocean seemingly to yourself."
8340,joking_sarcastic,"Well, I can't afford a cheeseburger but I guess I can own the whole ocean!"
8341,change,"How about sand, anyway? Have you ever played with that kinetic sand stuff?"
8342,continuation,"Right, definitely. It's the gift that keeps on giving as you clean you car year after year!"
8343,elaboration,"Yeah and you get to take with some nice blisters, beach hair, dirty sandals,..."
8344,joking_sarcastic,Perhaps you mean the bitch?
8345,change,"When winter comes, you can decorate your backyard to look like a ski resort! No sand required for that."
8346,continuation,You can also take shells and driftwood. Decorate your entire car like the beach.
8347,elaboration,If you get enough stuff you could even use it to make a beach scene in your backyard. Just don't take anything illegal. In some places it's illegal to take seashells.
8348,joking_sarcastic,Just don't go so far as to get cutouts of Gidget or the Beach Blanket Bingo movies for your set-up. That would be silly.
8349,change,"Although this time of year, getting stuff in your eye can be a big problem. Do you suffer from hay fever? Pollen, now that's a killer. And I'll be there's more pollen in this world than grains of sand."
8350,continuation,"Even small amounts can fell like a lot, though. For example, in your underpants."
8351,elaboration,"Although there are certainly large amounts of sand in certain parts of the world: take the Sahara Desert, for example."
8352,joking_sarcastic,I wouldn't want to get the Sahara Desert in my eye.
8353,change,Standing in the surfe with the water lapping over your feet is relaxing as well.
8354,continuation,If you dry it it hardens. I used to build a lot of sand castles  with hard sand. Digging in the sand was a lot of fun as a child.
8355,elaboration,I don't like it when people dig holes and don't fill them in though. They're a great way to sprain your ankle.
8356,joking_sarcastic,In the sand is also a nice place to get romantic.
8357,change,Do you know when John is coming over for dinner
8358,continuation,Yes I have got sand in a few unmentionables
8359,elaboration,I went to the beach on saturday. There was this kid who built an amazing sand castle
8360,joking_sarcastic,Heck getting sand in your feet is the best part
8361,change,"Talking about vacuuming the car, I hate having to clean the car. Some people find the experience ccalming, I can't stand having to do it."
8362,continuation,I also love having to beat the sand out of bags and blankets. It almost makes it seem like it's not worth it.
8363,elaboration,"Every time I'm standing on the beach at sunset though, I see why people do it. Even with the sand in your stuff and on your clothes it's still a magical experience."
8364,joking_sarcastic,"Unless it's raining, then there's I'd rather be anywhere else. Being hit with windy sand hurts!"
8365,change,Do you know anybody who has a backyard pool? I wonder how much they cost. Would save on gas money and time not having to drive to the beach on those hot days.
8366,continuation,"Especially if you have kids, you're vacuuming almost every day."
8367,elaboration,"But my kids love the beach, and the back seat gets filled with buckets and shovels and inflatable water toys. It's not just sand."
8368,joking_sarcastic,Maybe I should install a backyard pool! They won't want to put that in the back seat of the car!
8369,change,Vacuuming is a hassle. But at least you can't hear your screaming kids!
8370,continuation,"I love vacuuming my car too, haha, but it's worth it for all the fun we've had."
8371,elaboration,"Right, plus it's so fun given all the nice blisters, beach hair, sweat,..."
8372,joking_sarcastic,"Right, me too! I especially love that the sand never truly goes away even after years!"
8373,change,Do you know when Dave is getting home
8374,continuation,Me too I have gone to Lake Ontario a few times
8375,elaboration,The beach reminds me of a peaceful place
8376,joking_sarcastic,I wouldn't imagine getting sand in your shoes is very comfortable. But that's all part of the beach experience
8377,change,"Actually, lakes can have some weird stuff in them. Have you ever stepped on anything squirmy in the lake? I hear they've got eels and bloodsuckers, icky."
8378,continuation,I actually prefer lakes to the ocean. Salt water makes you feel so sticky when you dry off.
8379,elaboration,"You can do a lot of the same things in a lake as in the ocean, except maybe surfing. If the lake is big enough, you can go sail boating, and they have these new boards now you can stand on and paddle your way around."
8380,joking_sarcastic,No need to worry about sharks in a lake! Unless you go to Loch Ness; watch out for the Loch Ness monster!
8381,change,"I know it's kind of silly, but I really enjoy watching those shows about people who hunt for lake monsters."
8382,continuation,"Lakes are pretty nice, especially if you can go out on a boat."
8383,elaboration,Lakes always remind me of the times my Dad took me fishing.
8384,joking_sarcastic,You like lakes? I like lakes. Have you ever had the luck to eat leeks at a lake?
8385,change,I prefer the ocean though. There's something magical about the cool water.
8386,continuation,The only thing I don't really like is the sand.
8387,elaboration,I've been going to the beach since I was very young.
8388,joking_sarcastic,The beach is best with a bucket of beer.
8389,change,"I like the sound of flowing water, but I prefer a fountain or a babbling brook."
8390,continuation,"The sound of the surf is nice, there's a reason they use it for those machines that play relaxation sounds."
8391,elaboration,"I do like the sounds at the beach, the surf but also the wind and seagulls, too."
8392,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, ""Those waves are gnarly, dude."" No, wait, that's the sound of the surfers."
8393,change,Speaking of sound have you tried holding a shell to your ear?
8394,continuation,Oh the sound is so delightful especially when taking a nap.
8395,elaboration,Well the surf actually helps keep the sand nice and clean.
8396,joking_sarcastic,Really? All there is to love and that's what you choose?
8397,change,Was it sunny when you went to the beach
8398,continuation,I once got pooped on by a seagul
8399,elaboration,Those creatures are so discusting
8400,joking_sarcastic,Hope you were able to get it out
8401,change,"Stepping on sea shells is another hazard at the beach. If you get your foot cut, always remember to disinfect it since open wounds can pick up infections at the beach."
8402,continuation,Nothing is worse than having your food stolen by sea gulls.
8403,elaboration,The sand feels good as it squishes between your toes.
8404,joking_sarcastic,A seagull stole my entire sandwich one day and then pooped on me afterwards!
8405,change,"Sometimes it creeps me out a little to think about all the fish pooping in the water, where it all mixes together so you can't even step around it."
8406,continuation,"And as luck would have it, you usually get to bring some of that home on your car, too."
8407,elaboration,"And when they're not pooping they're eating garbage, so they're kind of disgusting at both ends."
8408,joking_sarcastic,"People are always trying to say how beautiful and majestic nature is, but I estimate that it's about 30% poop."
8409,change,Maybe I should build the kids a tree house. We've got a big tree in the back yard with some nice large low-hanging branches. How hard do you think that would be?
8410,continuation,"Ain't that the truth! You know, I thought about making a sandbox in the back yard. Of course, I'd have to buy the sand. If everyone took sand home from the beach to make a sandbox, there'd be no beach left!"
8411,elaboration,"I need to make this before my kids get too old and lose interest. It would be so good for them, to be outside playing in the fresh air instead of stuck inside watching TV all the time."
8412,joking_sarcastic,"However, I do have cats... and you know what cats like to do in the sandbox!"
8413,change,"Speaking of sand, do you have a sand box? I've been looking for one for the boys."
8414,continuation,"I know what you mean, we bring tons of sand back home with us every year."
8415,elaboration,"I tried vacuuming it out last year, but that stuff gets everywhere."
8416,joking_sarcastic,"We had so much sand in the van, it was flying in my eyes driving home."
8417,change,Fishing is a unique beach experience because you can directly profit from your work.
8418,continuation,If you want to make a unique planter you can fil a pot with sand and seashells.
8419,elaboration,Collecting sea shells is another exciting activity at the beach.
8420,joking_sarcastic,I'm not sure the environmentalists agree with me but collecting pretty sea shells has always been fun.
8421,change,I like water parks too.  Have you ever bee to one?  I think they are a lot of fun even though I did have a scary experience at one growing up.
8422,continuation,Hmm.  I'm not sure if it's technically trespassing or not.  It sure seems like a good way to make your neighbor mad though.  It would probably be the last time they invited you to swim.
8423,elaboration,I'm not sure.  A bunch of us tried to go swimming in a hotel pool that we weren't staying at once.  We got ran off by staff pretty quickly by hotel staff. Apparently there are all kids of liability issues.  I imagine there are liability issues for homeowners too.
8424,joking_sarcastic,Ha Ha.  I guess I need to be very specific when I give you an invitation.  I'll be keeping a closer eye on you from now on.
8425,change,I enjoy swimming in lakes and all the activities that you can do in a lake. I have many fond memories of jumping on water trampolines over a lake when I was young.
8426,continuation,It's a lot of fun. I used to be able to skinny dip in our pool since we had hedges all around our property that blocked peoples view.
8427,elaboration,It's such a freeing feeling to glide through the water and feel it sliding past your body.
8428,joking_sarcastic,"I'll tell you something though, if you're skinny dipping in a lake you better hope that you don't get bitten where the sun doesn't shine."
8429,change,I love putting bath bombs in the bath. Do you have a favorite bath bomb to use?
8430,continuation,I enjoy putting bubbles in  the bath. I think it makes it even more relaxing.
8431,elaboration,A bath is a nice thing after the beach because the beach can actually be quite a pain. After cleaning the sand off of everything you deserve to relax!
8432,joking_sarcastic,Baths are so relaxing with all the dirt from your body floating around!
8433,change,"Totally, but what do you think about the mountains? Have you ever gone hiking?"
8434,continuation,"Yes, not to mention the unpacking and laundry that has to be done too."
8435,elaboration,"I totally agree, I hate leaving the beach too. There's nothing like the beach, the sights, smells, and sounds. It's amazing."
8436,joking_sarcastic,"Or you can just throw everything away and buy all new stuff, including the sandy car!"
8437,change,Do you burn easy in the sun?
8438,continuation,The beach is my favorite place to be.
8439,elaboration,I love walking along the edge of the sand near the water. I get the sand off my feet before I go in my car.
8440,joking_sarcastic,Well you could live in your car with all the sand.
8441,change,"I don't know, I'm arguing with my family about it, so I don't even want to talk about it. What I really want to do is take a month off and work on my book. But I don't think I'm going to be able to do that. Let me tell you what I was thinking about in terms of the next chapter, though, okay?"
8442,continuation,"Oh boy, that's a good question. We've been trying to figure it out, but I'm not sure about my work schedule yet, so I don't know how much time I'm gonna have, which is going to determine where we can go. So I don't know, which is driving me crazy a little bit, to be honest."
8443,elaboration,"I'm definitely going to take one. I get a little stir crazy if I don't. Last year, when it got to be around this time of year, I found myself getting so tense all the time, and it finally occurred to me that I was long overdue for some time off. It was affecting my mood in a really significant way."
8444,joking_sarcastic,"Oh yeah, I'm scheduling a trip around the world even as we speak. The only thing standing in the way is the fact that I've already used all my vacation days for my brother's stupid wedding, so no, my round-the-world trip is canceled, thanks for bringing it up."
8445,change,I do adore the beach but I also like a nice serene lake.  Do you like lakes or are you just a beach person?
8446,continuation,"I know what you mean, you can clean your car forever and the sand just won't come out.  I have found that the best thing to do is try a commercial vacuum at the car wash.  Have you tried that?"
8447,elaboration,"I love Virginia Beach and have been there many time  My favorite beaches on the East Coast are up north in Cape Cod, those beaches are beautiful."
8448,joking_sarcastic,"I know what you mean, I swear sand seems to multiply once it gets in the car!"
8449,change,"I also like to visit the towns along Lake Michigan, they lake is so big it reminds me of the ocean."
8450,continuation,"That must have been a lot of fun visiting your grandma, what else did you guys do besides go to the beach?"
8451,elaboration,I really like to walk on the beach and find interesting shells and rocks.
8452,joking_sarcastic,That sand on your feet is good for exfoliating your feet!
8453,change,That's why I prefer getting onto the ocean from a dock. As long as I don't have to get sandy I'm happy.
8454,continuation,Nothing is worse than getting salt water in the seats.
8455,elaboration,It always ends up making the car smelly because it soaks in and it's difficult to get out. If it's really bad you might just have to get the interior detailed.
8456,joking_sarcastic,Isn't it terrible to go to the beach because it's free only to spend 200 dollars having your car cleaned and detailed.
8457,change,"My car has rust, I have to find a repair shop."
8458,continuation,"I do too, it is great exercise."
8459,elaboration,"A car full of sand does not remind me of a day at the beach, it reminds me that I have to go clean my car."
8460,joking_sarcastic,You can cook the fish and crabs for dinner.
8461,change,I like to watch nature films about the sea though. It's fascinating how diverse life in the water can be. I was watching recently about creatures that live completely in the dark thousands of feet below the surface.
8462,continuation,I don't like the beach for that reason. What's fun about getting dirty?
8463,elaboration,I sympathize what with all of the work that it takes and the number of days that you end up tracking sand everywhere it's just not for me.
8464,joking_sarcastic,Especially because there's so many creepy crawlies on the beach.
8465,change,What was the weather like that night?
8466,continuation,"Wow, that is awful."
8467,elaboration,"How big is the crack, what is your door made out of?"
8468,joking_sarcastic,Glass?
8469,change,I love looking for deals for everything. I got my computer so cheap because of a deal I found online!
8470,continuation,Purchasing a new car can be one of the most intimidating things.
8471,elaboration,"There are many deals when it comes to buying cars, but I think it is important to do a lot of research about what is the best deal to go with."
8472,joking_sarcastic,Sometimes it seems like buying a car is more about the deals than the actual car!
8473,change,Take a look in the local newspaper classifieds. Sometimes you can find a decent private sale and even bring it to a friend or mechanic you trust to take a close look or use a place like Carfax where you can get detailed previous ownership details.
8474,continuation,It is probably better to do the options checking for the model you like before going to the dealership.
8475,elaboration,But I understand what you mean. Before you know it a slick salesman will have you getting things that you will never use like a ski rack in southern California.
8476,joking_sarcastic,Perhaps getting a smaller car like a Barbie play car would take off the sales pressure.
8477,change,"It's kind of strange how technology turns out. Way back when they thought we'd all be controlling our own flying cars, but it turns out that we're going to have computers drive us around on the ground."
8478,continuation,"That will be pretty cool. It will be like having a chauffeur. ""Jeeves, take me to the beach!"""
8479,elaboration,"Probably. I think I'll miss driving myself once everything gets fully automated, especially out on the open road where you can really feel in control. Maybe I should get something sporty while I've still got time."
8480,joking_sarcastic,"Probably. I bet I'll still have to vacuum up the sand myself, though."
8481,change,Your wife seemed busy this afternoon.
8482,continuation,"If I take car of this new car like it should be taken care of, maybe I will not have to buy another for a long time."
8483,elaboration,I have a whole calendar of scheduled maintenance that I will need to follow up on to keep my new car healthy.
8484,joking_sarcastic,"I told my wife since i have to do all this maintenance , she is responsible for the cars education, make sure it is brought up correctly."
8485,change,I don't mind boat shopping as much though. There's just something engaging about the diversity of boat models that makes shopping for them a lot more enjoyable.
8486,continuation,The decision is always difficult because there's just so many options to choose from. I always wish I could skip the buying part and just find out what I end up picking.
8487,elaboration,I know how difficult it can be to deal with sales people. They're always trying to push you to buy something that's just out of your price range and they make every deal sound so good.
8488,joking_sarcastic,Nothing is worse than to show up at a dealership and have some man talking a million miles an hour in your face! They could ask me to trade in my first born child and I'd probably agree before I realized what they asked me.
8489,change,"Wow. That reminds me of my grandfather, he had a pretty extensive coin collection."
8490,continuation,Really? That's amazing. The most interesting thing I've ever found is cool-looking shells.
8491,elaboration,"Wow. I sometimes see people with metal detectors there, but I figured that nobody ever actually finds anything worthwhile."
8492,joking_sarcastic,"Like a pirate treasure gold coin, or one of those infomercial commemorative coins?"
8493,change,"I've never actually been to the beach before noon, but I really like to run around the lake near my house in the morning. It's good exercise, and I get in touch with nature a bit."
8494,continuation,"My favorite time to walk along the beach is at night. The sunsets make me feel so beautiful and peaceful, and since I'm an introvert, it's a good way to get some alone time."
8495,elaboration,Me too. I love to smell the fresh ocean air and hear the waves crash. It's my favorite way to begin the day when I vacation in Florida.
8496,joking_sarcastic,"I enjoy walking on the beach in the morning too. There's no people out, so I can't accidentally knock over someone's umbrella or trip over a little kid's sand castle. You know me, I'm naturally clumsy. That's something I've accidentally done."
8497,change,I enjoy traveling to the islands. The Bahamas and Caribbean are beautiful places to visit.
8498,continuation,I've always wished that I could own a private beach. I hate the crowds on the beach and the fact that you can never set up where you want.
8499,elaboration,The feeling of being alone at the beach is extremely relaxing. I often feel like none of my worldly cares matter for a few moments.
8500,joking_sarcastic,If I had my own private beach I think the best thing about it would be the chance to stride up to somebody and tell them to get off my island!
8501,change,"You totally could. Which reminds me, are you going away at Christmastime this year? I was wondering if you could dog sit for me if you're going to be in town."
8502,continuation,"I suppose you could. I've never gone quite that far, but I do love getting my house and yard all festive looking at Christmas time. I like to go overboard, to be honest."
8503,elaboration,"Sure, ski resort. Or Santa's compound type of an area. Or like Ice Station Zebra, like a remote research base in a distant frozen location. Yeah, the snow gives you a ton of options."
8504,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, gee, I guess you could. And you could always dress your garage up to look like a mental hospital and check yourself in for observation. Just make sure to tell the doctors that you like to pretend your backyard is a ski resort. They'll rush you right in, I'm sure."
8505,change,"I do love when I can take stuff home from the beach too. One beach I was at sold tropical plants we could bring home, and it was so much more authentic than a generic beach scene."
8506,continuation,"Yeah, it's hard to remember all the exact rules of each beach. But I appreciate how much beaches work to preserve their beauty, especially those in national parks."
8507,elaboration,"I wonder why exactly it's illegal. I mean, it's not like the seashells are being used anymore."
8508,joking_sarcastic,"I dropped a seashell in my bag by accident once when I was at the beach, and I panicked as I was leaving when I noticed it, and I had to frantically run and put it back. The lifeguards were laughing so hard."
8509,change,I've always been pretty comfortable giving speeches. The experience doesn't fill me with as much anxiety as it does for some people.
8510,continuation,I feel for people with allergies. It's hard to hide from something that you're allergic to when it's in the air everywhere.
8511,elaboration,It's like walking through a world of poison!
8512,joking_sarcastic,And don't you hate it when you have to give a speech and your nose is clogged and you end up sounding like donold duck?
8513,change,Breaking a bone is an unforgettable experience for sure. That's one of those pains that you just can't forget.
8514,continuation,Sometimes I'm so civic minded that I'll go ahead and fill them in. Nothing is more awkward than to be on your hands and knees as an adult covering over some childs sandcastle.
8515,elaboration,I hate spraining an ankle. I always end up doing it when walking along curbs.
8516,joking_sarcastic,Limping gives me a good excuse not to exercise though.
8517,change,I like romantic movies but I hate when I end up crying. Nothing feels more silly on a first date!
8518,continuation,Romantic evenings on the beach are a great way to feel connected and passionate. Sitting on the sand under the stars is enchanting.
8519,elaboration,Some of my best romantic memories are beach picnics.
8520,joking_sarcastic,It's unfortunate but all the fairy tale scenes that we laugh at in movies speak to us as people. I think that no matter how much you might claim that romantic movies aren't for you that everyone enjoys it when those situations actually happen.
8521,change,"It's going to rain tomorrow I heard, so they'll be gone."
8522,continuation,I have seen some talented creations made of sand that even involved seashells.
8523,elaboration,Some of them were over six feet tall.
8524,joking_sarcastic,Wouldn't want to stand too close to that one would ya.
8525,change,I prefer to take long walks on the beach with sandles. Running on the beach is a really good workout because of the resistance of the sand.
8526,continuation,It does feel warm and soft under your feet.
8527,elaboration,Don't you hate it when it gets between your toes though? And the clean up feels like it takes forever.
8528,joking_sarcastic,It's like turning into the sand monster!
8529,change,"Speaking of sunsets, have you ever seen the green flash? During perfect conditions, right before the sun completely sets, there's a bright green flash."
8530,continuation,Its one of the reasons why a lot of people get married on the beach.  The pictures are amazing: the couple's silhouette against crashing waves and white sand . . . it truly is something else.
8531,elaboration,"Not to mention being barefoot - sinking into the wet sand, makes you feel one with the earth."
8532,joking_sarcastic,You just have to make sure you don't sink too much or it's tough to get out!
8533,change,"By the way, are we still going to the  Cyndi Lauper concert next month?"
8534,continuation,Blowing up all those inflatable water toys sure can be a chore. I guess it keeps the ol' lungs healthy though and it sure beats having the kids sit in front of the tv all day.
8535,elaboration,"It does have its benefits though. We get a fabulous tan and  playing on the beach wears out the kids. By the time we get home, they are so tired and ready to hit the sack."
8536,joking_sarcastic,"You know what they say, "" Girls just want to have sun""."
8537,change,There never seems to be enough time to get away like there used to be.
8538,continuation,"For all the sand in my shoes, the sunburned noses and the smell of fish, I would pick up and go to the beach today if was possible."
8539,elaboration,My family used to spend weeks camping along one beach or another.
8540,joking_sarcastic,"During the summer I would turn feral: hair wild, face tanned dark, and the soles of my feet hard as leather."
8541,change,I love lakes and nature but I hate the cold. Nothing gets to me more than cold weather because it feels like you're freezing from the inside out.
8542,continuation,"I've always wanted to visit Canada. I hear that they have some beautiful greenery up there, and the scenery is supposed to be picturesque."
8543,elaboration,I'd love to go there in the summer to experience the beauty of the open woods but I'd hate the winters.
8544,joking_sarcastic,How don't you all freeze up there?
8545,change,"For me, the mountains make me thing of a perfect, ""happy place""."
8546,continuation,It's the same for me. The beach is a place where I can easily sit and meditate and pray.
8547,elaboration,"I feel like we can feel so rested at the beach because it calms all of our senses. We can touch the sand, hear the waves, smell the salt. All we have to do is buy a treat to eat and we have calming input coming into all of our senses!"
8548,joking_sarcastic,"See, ever since I watched Jaws, the beach isn't quite the same for me, you know?"
8549,change,How close do you live to the beach?  Is it a long drive to get there?
8550,continuation,"It is part of the whole experience, but cleaning the car can really take some time."
8551,elaboration,I love walking the beach but I also really enjoy playing in the waves.
8552,joking_sarcastic,"Sand in your shoes and a possible sunburn are part of the experience, neither of which makes it sound that fun!"
8553,change,I also like to kayak but for that I prefer the ocean.  Have you tried kayaking?
8554,continuation,"I have stepped on some weird creatures in the lake, but nothing scary enough to make me stop swimming."
8555,elaboration,I really like water skiing when I visit the lake.  It scary and fun at the same time.
8556,joking_sarcastic,I really hope I never step on an eel!  That would really freak me out.
8557,change,I love how smooth lakes are. They allow for a lot of unique water activities such as wake surfing.
8558,continuation,I have so many good memories of being out on lakes. I enjoyed extreme water sports such as wake boarding and skiing so I spent a lot of time on a ski boat on the water.
8559,elaboration,I would love to live on a lake one day.
8560,joking_sarcastic,As long as I didn't get eaten by an alligator!
8561,change,The mountains are nice too especially in the fall when the weather is nice and the leaves are changing.
8562,continuation,Paddle boards?  Those look like a lot of fun.  We should try to find some place we can rent a couple.
8563,elaboration,My favorite thing to a the lake near me is canoeing.  Every once and a while the park offers sunset canoe trips.  It is so peaceful and beautiful to be out on the lake at the end of the day.
8564,joking_sarcastic,Plus there's no chance of being eaten by JAWS.
8565,change,"Yeah, I like outdoor things in general. I'm a big fan of camping out, too. Not many people are, it seems, but I love a night in the woods in a tent, campfire, the whole nine yards."
8566,continuation,"Yeah, I like boating, too. I try and do it a lot during the summer, just go out to the lake and relax and spend time with friends or alone or whatever. Always a nice day."
8567,elaboration,"Yeah, I love boating. I just love the water in general, actually. I like boating, canoing, wake-boarding, scuba diving. Anything in the water, I'm cool with it."
8568,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, that's good thinking there. I was wondering why, when I go out without a boat, I always get drenched. That really had me stumped, but wow, I think you figured it out. You're a smart one, huh?"
8569,change,How is your Dad doing? I have not seen him in years.
8570,continuation,Fishing was more about just spending time with my Dad than about bringing in the big haul.
8571,elaboration,We would sit for hours gently rocking back and forth in a small fishing boat.
8572,joking_sarcastic,"If a fish did hit my fishing line, the shock would make me almost jump out of the boat."
8573,change,Cruises are another way to enjoy the ocean. Between the view and the free food I'm not sure why anyone would fly to an island destination.
8574,continuation,It's especially blissful to let yourself slip under the surface and float with the waves.
8575,elaboration,Sometimes I feel like I am at peace with everything when I'm standing in the surf.
8576,joking_sarcastic,I'm just worried that I'll get so relaxed that I fall asleep and wake up in Mexico!
8577,change,I'm looking forward to when I'll have my own kids to take to the beach.
8578,continuation,"Me too, although I appreciate it in a different way now. When I was a kid it was all about trying to cram as much fun in as possible, but now I can relax and appreciate the beauty."
8579,elaboration,"Not me, I grew up in the midwest and we didn't have beaches, so this is all pretty new to me."
8580,joking_sarcastic,Was that back when you crawled out of the primordial ooze?
8581,change,We could do some wake boarding if your up to it.
8582,continuation,Don't forget the lobster and clams.
8583,elaboration,Make that Corona beer and some limes.
8584,joking_sarcastic,"But no crabs, crabs are creepy looking."
8585,change,"Have you ever tried one of those relaxation sound machines? It's probably not as nice as the real thing, but now I'm wondering if playing the sound of waves would help me fall asleep at night."
8586,continuation,"Those are nice, but I prefer the surf, I feel like there's more variety, it's always changing, but kind of always the same, too."
8587,elaboration,"I like the sound of the ocean. It sounds so big, which makes me feel like my problems are smaller by comparison."
8588,joking_sarcastic,"Uh oh, I hope this doesn't turn into a fresh water vs. salt water rap battle."
8589,change,"Speaking of relaxation, I've been thinking about taking a class on meditation."
8590,continuation,If I wasn't concerned about getting too much sun I'd like to just lie down there and let it lull me to sleep.
8591,elaboration,"Yeah. It's kind of funny though, because there's so much movement and unpredictability with the waves, you'd think that would be associated with chaos and being all jumpy, not calmness and relaxing."
8592,joking_sarcastic,Leave it to humans to go through so much trouble to get away from nature and then build electronic gizmos to replicate it.
8593,change,The sounds at the beach are great but I love the sights too.  I could stare at the water all day long.  It's mesmerizing.
8594,continuation,"All of the sounds make for the perfect beach day, I also like looking out into the water and watching the sailboats."
8595,elaboration,Do you have any beach vacations planned this year?  They are always so relaxing.
8596,joking_sarcastic,"I love the seagulls, but sometimes they will come right down and steal your lunch!"
8597,change,"I'd like to walk around here more, but there's nowhere that you can get away from the sound of traffic, so I can never fully relax."
8598,continuation,"Hehe. Some of them are nice to look at, though."
8599,elaboration,Yeah. Sometimes the biggest problem with the beach is all the other people who like the beach.
8600,joking_sarcastic,"Ah, the song of my people, I know it well."
8601,change,"I also like to check out pools in the summer, sometimes it's nice not to have to deal with the sand."
8602,continuation,I have listened to shells many times.  My Mom used to tell me the ocean was talking to me.
8603,elaboration,I also love the sound of the surf especially because it may mean that there are big waves.
8604,joking_sarcastic,How about all the sand in the car after the beach?  That's no fun at all!
8605,change,"It is, I love when the water is warm around 80 degrees."
8606,continuation,"Me, too although not when the sand is hot. That is why I walk near the water."
8607,elaboration,"I hate when the sand is in my car, it is very hard to get out."
8608,joking_sarcastic,"Yes, until you fall sound asleep and the waves crash down on you cause you did not hear them."
8609,change,What do you think of the seagulls there?
8610,continuation,I love walking on the beach too. I especially like to find shells.
8611,elaboration,I love the sand as well but not in my car. it is really hard to clean out.
8612,joking_sarcastic,The sand is awful
8613,change,What beach is your favorite?
8614,continuation,Yes definitely I always keep Purell on me.
8615,elaboration,I also love the sunset at the beach too.
8616,joking_sarcastic,"It is so great when it gets really cold at the beach, I just love it."
8617,change,"Sometime I think about maybe getting a boat, I bet that's fun, too."
8618,continuation,"Ugh, now I'm thinking about what else squishes between my toes."
8619,elaboration,"And the water can rush over your feet every now and then, that's nice, too."
8620,joking_sarcastic,I try to squish the seagulls between my toes but they're too quick for me.
8621,change,Well some travel magazines could show you a lot of places to go if you want to take a trip someday.
8622,continuation,I would say that most of it  is beautiful although there are areas that could be classified as poop.
8623,elaboration,"Look at the Grand Canyon or the desserts, the Redwood Forest of Niagara Falls, they are all majestic."
8624,joking_sarcastic,"Or Harlem, or Detroit....."
8625,change,I love owning houses with wooded backyards. Nothing feels better than to lay out under a tree and sun yourself on a warm day.
8626,continuation,It depends on the age of the tree and what kinds of permits you might have to file. My grand father built me a treehouse and each year he'd expand it as his gift to me.
8627,elaboration,I hope your kids can have the same fond memories that I did of playing in one.
8628,joking_sarcastic,My treehouse even had power and a tv!
8629,change,I love when you can see all the different fish in the ocean.
8630,continuation,Sea shells are so pretty and make a great decoration in your house.
8631,elaboration,I really enjoying when you put a sea shell to your ear and you can hear the ocean.
8632,joking_sarcastic,Especially when you collect one with a crab in it.
8633,change,"No, but have you been to aquariums? All the water with none of the wet!"
8634,continuation,I've been to a ton! My favorite was in the Wisconsin Dells.
8635,elaboration,No way! The water there is super gross and dirty.
8636,joking_sarcastic,"I tried once, but my water doesn't get along with other water, so I just walk him around the block now."
8637,change,"That's true, the home owner's association might just have a coronary if he reported it."
8638,continuation,"Yeah, but this neighbor goes in my yard all the time. I don't think he would have minded."
8639,elaboration,"Yeah, but he invites everyone to his prestigious pool parties in summer. He would have to invite me again!"
8640,joking_sarcastic,Well if I happened to nonchalantly walk by his house with a plate of cookies he might change his mind.
8641,change,I love to bounce.
8642,continuation,That sounds like a fun experiences. Jumping on trampolines is always fun.
8643,elaboration,"Yea, I had a trampoline too. It was in my backyard."
8644,joking_sarcastic,Just dont eat before you trampoline
8645,change,Swimming is fun anywhere.
8646,continuation,"Yea, skinny dipping sounds pretty relaxing in nice water."
8647,elaboration,You skinny dipped? I would never!
8648,joking_sarcastic,You can skinny dip in my pool any day.
8649,change,Yea I love just relaxing.
8650,continuation,"Yea, I just love the thrill of that."
8651,elaboration,"Yea, that feeling of the water hitting your body is amazing."
8652,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, cold water on me. Great!"
8653,change,I feel like I'm ready for a nice bath now.
8654,continuation,I have lots of favorites. The cherry ones are the best.
8655,elaboration,"Yea, I have a couple favorites, but they are expensive."
8656,joking_sarcastic,My favorite is when I bathe without weird smells.
8657,change,Have you ever tried those beach scented bath bombs? They smell exactly like coconut and sunscreen.
8658,continuation,"Yeah, and beach sand is magical. It somehow makes your skin super soft."
8659,elaboration,"I know, right? Beach baths should just be a given."
8660,joking_sarcastic,"Yes, after stressing furiously at the beach, one must relieve themselves of that stress with a nice bath."
8661,change,I think driving through the mountains would be great since I could then see the sights.
8662,continuation,I don't think hiking is for me. It's a lot of hard work really.
8663,elaboration,I like the scenery of mountains but don't think I could handle hiking physically since I had my health issues.
8664,joking_sarcastic,I'd fall down the side of one and end up having to live in a cave.
8665,change,I love wearing lots of clothes.
8666,continuation,"Yea, those are all not fun. Thats the worst part of traveling."
8667,elaboration,"Yea, somebody has to do it  though."
8668,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, you could just be dirty."
8669,change,I love reading books.
8670,continuation,"Yea, what were you thinking about."
8671,elaboration,"Sure, it sounds like you  really have a great idea of what you're doing."
8672,joking_sarcastic,"Sure, spoil it so I don't want to read it. Go ahead."
8673,change,Your work schedule still hasn't calmed down? I thought it was the slow season?
8674,continuation,"If you know in the next week, I can let you know of some good hotel deals."
8675,elaboration,In those cases I just make plans and have work bend around my needs.
8676,joking_sarcastic,"As long as it's driving, can we carpool?"
8677,change,I like to travel anywhere.
8678,continuation,Sometimes you need a vacation for your mental health.
8679,elaboration,"yea, sometimes you just need to get away."
8680,joking_sarcastic,"Sometimes, you need a vacation from a vacation though."
8681,change,I love having lots of vacation days at my job.
8682,continuation,You had to cancel the trip because you had no vacation days?
8683,elaboration,Why would you use up all your vacation days with a trip planned?
8684,joking_sarcastic,See if you can just buy more days.
8685,change,"My neighbor's kids are doing some kind of charity car wash for their school this weekend, they made me promise I'd bring mine."
8686,continuation,"Huh, I never thought of that, I guess when I think ""vacuum"" my mind just automatically goes to the thing I use to clean the house, but maybe I could give that a shot."
8687,elaboration,"No, I haven't. That car washes around here charge extra for that, and that just seems wrong to me. I'm already paying to wash the car, the other stuff should be free!"
8688,joking_sarcastic,"I'm actually thinking of going in the other direction and just letting it build up, and then when there's so much sand that there's not room for people anymore we'll know it's time to trade the car in for a new one."
8689,change,I once had dinner in cape cod.
8690,continuation,Those beaches are amazing and not usually all that crowded.
8691,elaboration,"Yea, those beaches have amazing water. They are beautiful"
8692,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, give me Florida."
8693,change,Do you do anything when you go to the lakes? Do you visit any of the tourist attractions or great shops? I'll show you some if you want.
8694,continuation,The grate lakes are awesome. They're like the ocen in the sense that there are sandy beaches and a lot of water.
8695,elaboration,I go to Lake Michigan pretty often because I have family in Ludington. You could always come with me.
8696,joking_sarcastic,Last time I went with my little niece and my sister. The child kept calling it Lake Missy-Gone.
8697,change,I just wanna live at the beach.
8698,continuation,We did a lot of talking and playing sports.
8699,elaboration,"We just enjoyed life. Ate, talked, played."
8700,joking_sarcastic,We did a lot of soul searching.
8701,change,I just love being able to go to the beach.
8702,continuation,Sometimes taking long walks is relaxing and is good for your health.
8703,elaboration,"Yea, sometimes you can find really cool things that way."
8704,joking_sarcastic,Do the rocks sound like the ocean?
8705,change,I'll find something to get the smell out. I hear vinegar mixed with peroxide is a good cleaner and deodorizer.
8706,continuation,"You have to make sure the towels are dry, though, and I'm not sure we have enough."
8707,elaboration,We use towels to dry off and need to pack extra for the ride home.
8708,joking_sarcastic,The inside of this car is going to smell like a mermaid's bedroom.
8709,change,I have to get my car fixed soon.
8710,continuation,How many repair shops are in your area?
8711,elaboration,Where's the closest repair shop?
8712,joking_sarcastic,Why don't you just google one.
8713,change,I love watching anything that plays on my TV set.
8714,continuation,Nature films can feature some really chilling things.
8715,elaboration,"Yea, its amazing what nature can do sometimes."
8716,joking_sarcastic,I prefer to just be out in nature.
8717,change,"I can never decide what to buy between a laptop, desktop, or tablet. There's just so many choices on the shelves these days that I try to stick to brands that I recognize."
8718,continuation,"The best time to shop online is black Friday. I've gotten multiple computers and devices on sale as much as 50% off, it just requires patience."
8719,elaboration,It's always nice to get a discount on purchasing a computer. If not they can be super expensive.
8720,joking_sarcastic,Not to mention that you have to change computers like underwear these days.
8721,change,"I get tempted to ask my Dad to do the negotiating for me. I'd feel like a baby not doing it myself, but he has so much more experience that I know he'd make a better deal than I would."
8722,continuation,"Yeah, they're so expensive that I get nervous that I'll make a mistake in the negotiation, which ironically makes it more likely that I'll make a mistake."
8723,elaboration,The people that sell them have so much more information that it always feels like they have the advantage.
8724,joking_sarcastic,"Yes, it's very intimidating, I think that's why muggers are switching from knives and guns to offering deals on Toyota Camrys."
8725,change,I love to buy things.
8726,continuation,"Yea, you should always do research before approaching a salesperson."
8727,elaboration,"Research is always good to do when you are buying anything, isn't it?"
8728,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, just do a research paper about it."
8729,change,I love car shopping.
8730,continuation,You really do have to try hard to find the best deal when searching for a new car.
8731,elaboration,"Yea, I like to look around a lot when I'm trying to buy a new car."
8732,joking_sarcastic,Why not just ask your friend to sell you his.
8733,change,I love purchasing cars.
8734,continuation,I think you should do lots of research before talking to a salesman.
8735,elaboration,You might wanna look up many cars before going to a dealer. I agree
8736,joking_sarcastic,"Well, you wouldn't wanna get scammed by the sales person."
8737,change,I usually spend my money wisely.
8738,continuation,"Yea, thats happened to the best of us. Sales men know how to sell."
8739,elaboration,"Yea, those sales people can be tough to get along with."
8740,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, well their job is to sell."
8741,change,I like to play on my computer.
8742,continuation,"Yea, computers can do it all these days."
8743,elaboration,It sure is amazing what computers can do!
8744,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, computers sure rule our lives, dont they?"
8745,change,"It would probably named ""Siri"" or ""Alexa"" though. I've noticed all the artificial intelligence bots are named after girls."
8746,continuation,What kind of car are you thinking about getting until Jeeves drives into your life?
8747,elaboration,"I'm not too sure it would be completely safe, though. What if the car wrecks itself and you can't stop it?"
8748,joking_sarcastic,Yeah. Your own personal designated driver for those crazy Friday nights.
8749,change,I love the open road. That's why I like to run so much. There is nothing like finishing a marathon.
8750,continuation,Sports cars are the best. I feel so free and open when I get to drive my brother's Mazda.
8751,elaboration,Or a motorcycle. That's still just you and the highway. What a feeling!
8752,joking_sarcastic,"That sounds fun. I'd just embrace the self driving revolution, personally. I like to be as lazy as possible."
8753,change,"I think you should definitely keep the one you have, and maybe get a bicycle so we can go biking."
8754,continuation,"That is a really good long term strategy, financially. You never really should have to buy a brand new one."
8755,elaboration,"I think if you make sure to change the oil frequently, it should last a good long while."
8756,joking_sarcastic,Or you could downgrade to a moped!
8757,change,Sometimes I get a little jealous of people who live in cities and can get away with not even having a car.
8758,continuation,I suppose that's better than having to deal with unexpected breakdowns.
8759,elaboration,"Yeah, I should have done a better job back when mine was new, I'm paying for that now."
8760,joking_sarcastic,"Hey, are you buying the car or is the car buying you?"
8761,change,Cars are fun to talk about aren't they.
8762,continuation,What exactly does that mean? What is she responsible for?
8763,elaboration,You're giving her a big role it seems like?
8764,joking_sarcastic,Is the car a human? It gets an education?
8765,change,I love shopping for cars.
8766,continuation,You do love shopping for boats?
8767,elaboration,What boat are you gonna buy now? A bigger one?
8768,joking_sarcastic,A bigger boat is a lighter wallet.
8769,change,I love buying things. I'm a spender.
8770,continuation,"Yea, buying stuff is always hard when you don't have tons of money."
8771,elaboration,I think buying is the best part. Its kinda like gambling.
8772,joking_sarcastic,"Well, if I could avoid buying things while still enjoying the pleasure from them, I would."
8773,change,"I wish I could just hire an agent or something who would take care of it for me, but then I'd just end up worrying that the agent was ripping me off instead of the sales people."
8774,continuation,"Yeah, and they know how tempting it is for you to just agree to the deal to get it over with."
8775,elaboration,"And since they refine their approach with every person they sell to they know what techniques work, the deck is stacked in their favor."
8776,joking_sarcastic,"The trick is to pretend you don't speak English, then they won't be so pushy about trying to sell you a car. They will try to rush you off the lot, though, so there are pros and cons."
8777,change,I just like my car that I have now.
8778,continuation,"Yea, they can confuse the heck out of you sometimes."
8779,elaboration,"Yea, some cars salesman speak a mile a minute."
8780,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, they talk faster than they think."
8781,change,"Yeah, I found it, but then my little brother took it and lost it again. He was just a little kid so it's probably not fair to blame him, but I was so mad at the time!"
8782,continuation,Yeah. I was just walking and hit something with my foot. I would have kept on going but I noticed something shiny when I looked down so I stopped and picked it up.
8783,elaboration,"Yeah, it was a 1908 double eagle. Somebody must have dropped it from a collection or something, I can't imagine how else it could have gotten there."
8784,joking_sarcastic,"Wait, wait, wait. You had shells on your beach? Now I feel like I got ripped off."
8785,change,"Yes, it's quite hard, like a needle in a haystack. But a lot of things are like that. I used to be a bird watcher, and it would take me years to find specific birds that were supposed to be at the beach."
8786,continuation,"Yes, I found it accidentally. My grandfather used metal detectors and he only found one coin on the beach in twenty years of looking."
8787,elaboration,Anything you do in nature takes a lot of dedication. I admire how hard people who treasure hunt work on finding stuff on the beach.
8788,joking_sarcastic,"You know, no one finds anything worthwhile, but it's still a better shot than the lottery, huh?"
8789,change,Oh man remember those chocolate pirate gold coins?
8790,continuation,"Yeah, just one of those 9/11 ones."
8791,elaboration,"Neither, I think some foreign traveler dropped a pound sterling."
8792,joking_sarcastic,Both! It was a pirate commemorative coin!
8793,change,I love to walk around the ocean.
8794,continuation,What kind of exercise do you do? Walk?
8795,elaboration,Exercise is always fun! I like it!
8796,joking_sarcastic,What kind of exercise is staring?
8797,change,We should go take some photos of the beach at night or in the morning. It would be pretty.
8798,continuation,Nights can be a good time too. It depends on the temp for me. I don't like to be chilly.
8799,elaboration,I also like the birds being active so I can watch them and mornings seem to be better for that.
8800,joking_sarcastic,I am not much of a morning person either so the beach gives me an incentive to keep from sleeping till noon.
8801,change,If you wanted to we could plan a vacation to the ocean this summer. We could share a cottage.
8802,continuation,I would love to wake up with the ocean nearby. I have always dreamed of that.
8803,elaboration,I considered moving near the ocean but I'm not sure I could afford to.
8804,joking_sarcastic,"I'd never leave the beach, though, so I'd get permanently coated in salt."
8805,change,I like to be clean all the time.
8806,continuation,"Yea, you are very clumsy. You've done a lot of silly stuff."
8807,elaboration,I don't think that your clumsy. You just dont pay attention.
8808,joking_sarcastic,You are one clumsy soul.
8809,change,"Yea, I wanna vacation someday. I hope!"
8810,continuation,I love those places. They all have beautiful beaches.
8811,elaboration,"Yea, those places are all majestic. They have good food too."
8812,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, the only problem is I have no money."
8813,change,"It's always about scantily clad women with you, isn't it?"
8814,continuation,That's not bad. Also don't have to worry about throwing a football into another group or having someone kick sand on you.
8815,elaboration,And no stupid planes flying buy hauling messages about where to eat and interrupting your nap.
8816,joking_sarcastic,But how are you going to look at other women in their bikinis if no one else is there?
8817,change,"The beach is a really nice place to relax, but sometimes a nice deep tissue massage is just what I need to relax and escape reality."
8818,continuation,I can relate. Even though it feels like you're alone there are millions of sea creatures in the water that you'll never see.
8819,elaboration,I think the beach can be a great place to go when you're stressed and need work. The white noise of the water is a constant background sound that makes getting work done easier.
8820,joking_sarcastic,At least until the tide comes up and you get wet!
8821,change,"I wish I was rich enough to have beachfront property, but unless I hit the lottery I don't see it happening."
8822,continuation,"Having your own beach would be awesome, you'd get all the benefits without the hassles of getting back and forth."
8823,elaboration,"That would be sweet, I always feel so hemmed in by the other people at a public beach."
8824,joking_sarcastic,"No, you've got it backwards, if you've got your own island you don't let them leave unless they can survive you hunting them for sport."
8825,change,I would but I have to be in Orlando for a business trip. That place is the worst during Christmas.
8826,continuation,I am actually going to be home this Christmas. I'd love to help out. How is old Rufus?
8827,elaboration,"Actually I'm going to see my grandma this year. I'd love to help watch your Rufus, though."
8828,joking_sarcastic,Do I get to sample your Grandma's fruitcake again?
8829,change,Don't you just love the holidays.
8830,continuation,Some nice decorations around Christmas are always fun.
8831,elaboration,I like to do decorations as well. Especially Hanukkah ones.
8832,joking_sarcastic,Just don't burn your house down.
8833,change,I like to enjoy the sun as much as i can
8834,continuation,Sometimes its nice being able to just enjoy the elements.
8835,elaboration,"Yea, sometimes snow can be extremely pretty and relaxing."
8836,joking_sarcastic,I just love falling on snow and busting my butt.
8837,change,I think I'm going to just skip that and plant flowers this year.
8838,continuation,That is epic. I'm sure they would be laughing about that for days.
8839,elaboration,"As much as I like decorations in my yard, I don't think I would go that far with it."
8840,joking_sarcastic,Are you trying to tell me something? I assure you that I am completely sane most of the time. That changes when I'm equipped with spaghettios.
8841,change,I just love being at the beach.
8842,continuation,Taking home free gifts from anywhere is always nice.
8843,elaboration,Its fun when you can collect shells from the beach.
8844,joking_sarcastic,Free gifts are the best gifts.
8845,change,Laws in natural areas vary so much from country to country. Sometimes you can't move a single thing off of the path!
8846,continuation,"Oh I love the beaches in national parks. Acadia National Park in Maine has some amazing beaches, right by the mountains. It has all the restful things in one place."
8847,elaboration,"Yes, we need rules so we don't completely destroy the lovely environment of our beaches."
8848,joking_sarcastic,"Yep, if our beaches weren't beautiful, we wouldn't have much at all."
8849,change,The cops have to do their job.
8850,continuation,"Yea, that is true. It really shouldn't be illegal."
8851,elaboration,Sometimes things that are illegal are questionable.
8852,joking_sarcastic,"Well, its still illegal, smarty!"
8853,change,"I used to want to be a lifeguard, but I discovered that I'm afraid of being responsible for someone's life."
8854,continuation,Oh good lord. That's too funny. I would've just left it there and pretended not to notice.
8855,elaboration,I'm sure those life gaurds see a lot of that.
8856,joking_sarcastic,I bet they thought you were a real criminal!
8857,change,I just like talking to people.
8858,continuation,"Yea, you just gotta imagine everyone with their pants down."
8859,elaboration,Sometimes I've tried to just practice so much that I feel comfortable.
8860,joking_sarcastic,Why not just picture everyone naked?
8861,change,"Yea, it sucks being sick."
8862,continuation,"Yea, I do not enjoy sneezing all the time."
8863,elaboration,"Yea, it really limits what they can do."
8864,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, they might as well just die I guess."
8865,change,"Yeah, I used to fiddle around with voice acting as a kid. We would record audio tapes of our voices and pretend to be doing commercials."
8866,continuation,"Oh my gosh, yes.  I used to get horrible sinus infections as a kid."
8867,elaboration,I'm terribly allergic to pollen. I get stuffed up every year.
8868,joking_sarcastic,Well you could always become the next Donald Duck actor.
8869,change,"Spraining something is a bad pain too. You know in your head it's not broken, but it still hurts horribly."
8870,continuation,Especially when it spoils such a nice trip like a beach vacation. I broke my wrist at the beach when I was ten and it was awful.
8871,elaboration,"Yes, especially if you break an arm or a leg. Somehow, that's just worse."
8872,joking_sarcastic,"It's a wonderful memory, that's why you can't forget!"
8873,change,"Speaking of holes, these moles keep digging in my backyard. It's driving me nuts."
8874,continuation,"Yeah, I don't think I would go out of my way to fill in holes. Haha, I can see you doing it though."
8875,elaboration,"Yeah, exactly. I don't think people realize that they are creating a death trap, though."
8876,joking_sarcastic,Nothing would please me more than to see you out at the crack of dawn covering holes with a kiddie shovel.
8877,change,I love comedy movies.
8878,continuation,"I just hate crying at movies too, but sometimes its hard not to."
8879,elaboration,"Yea, at least the other person sees your soft side."
8880,joking_sarcastic,Oh cry me a river.
8881,change,Definitely. Have you tried that cafe near the beach?  It's really lovely and romantic as well.  I went there on my first date with my fiancee.
8882,continuation,"I agree - I also love swimming together at the beach on a really hot day, or just laying around reading together in the sun."
8883,elaboration,"I agree, or watching the sunset over the ocean is also very romantic."
8884,joking_sarcastic,"Yep, and so is all that sand in your hair when you get home."
8885,change,Have you ever been to a picnic with any of your recent boyfriends. I know the guy you dated in college used to take you.
8886,continuation,"I like going to the beach but don't find it especially romantic. It's fun, though."
8887,elaboration,I prefer to swim and play around on the beach instead of just sitting around.
8888,joking_sarcastic,Sand in my clothes doesn't strike me as too romantic.
8889,change,"Yea, I love my wife."
8890,continuation,"Yea, I agree. We all really do!"
8891,elaboration,"Yea, most people enjoy being in romantic situations and thats why we watch."
8892,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I get in romantic situations all the time. Just saying"
8893,change,So do you like to play in sand?
8894,continuation,I always hated making a great castle only to see it ruined. I used to get pictures of them at least.
8895,elaboration,I used to incorporate shells and sea weed into my castles as decoration.
8896,joking_sarcastic,I spent more time building castles than a medieval architect.
8897,change,I was watching this documentary the other day about this festival in Iceland where they have all sorts of crazy sculptures made out of ice.
8898,continuation,They can get so intricate! I wouldn't even know how to start making something that fancy.
8899,elaboration,I remember trying to build sand castles as a kid and they just turned out as wet lumps. I don't know how they do it.
8900,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe I wouldn't have such a stickiness problem if I stuck to the non-castle sand, but I feel an obligation. SOMEBODY's got to stomp on them, right?"
8901,change,I love to run.
8902,continuation,"You can run a short distance on the beach, but still get a workout."
8903,elaboration,Sometimes its nice to run and know that you are not far away.
8904,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I love running, but not moving."
8905,change,I love watching the sunset over my house.
8906,continuation,"I have not seen a bright green flash, but I have seen pink clouds."
8907,elaboration,"I have not seen that, but I would love to."
8908,joking_sarcastic,"No, are you delusional?"
8909,change,I was cleaning out my closet the other day and found a box of old photos. There's something about physical photos that brings back memories that I think we're losing out on in this Facebook and Instagram era.
8910,continuation,"They say that all life began in the sea, I wonder if that has anything to do with why it seems so fascinating."
8911,elaboration,"Sunset at the beach is very poetic, it's the time between day and night, at the place between the land and ocean."
8912,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, and divorces happen at the drab courthouse. Although with the way some people think about it maybe they'd be better off doing it the other way around."
8913,change,I love being on the beach.
8914,continuation,"yea, that is one of the best feelings ever."
8915,elaboration,"Yea, I just love being able to sink in the dirt."

8927,elaboration,"Yea, blowing up water toys can really be a workout."
8928,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I would rather just pay money to get a pump..."
8929,change,"If we move again we're thinking of trying to find a place with a pool in the back yard, I think the kids would enjoy that."
8930,continuation,"That's true. But I hate it when they get to that state where they're tired enough to be cranky but not tired enough to fall asleep in the car, that makes the drive miserable."
8931,elaboration,"Maybe, but it's such a production. Getting all that stuff in and out of the car gets me tired out, too!"
8932,joking_sarcastic,"It's amazing how playing at a beach can tire a kid out, but they seem to have boundless energy when it comes to asking ""can we go to the beach?"" over and over again."
8933,change,You can also try putting plastic over your seats after the beach but that's annoying to do.
8934,continuation,There is a car wash near my house where I take the car after the beach. You pay one price and can use the vacuums as much as you need to.
8935,elaboration,If you want to try it I have a free gift card you can use. I won it.
8936,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe you don't want to use it, though. Maybe the sand helps exfoliate your skin."
8937,change,I just wanna have time for sleep and food.
8938,continuation,"Yea, its tough when you're working and have a job."
8939,elaboration,"Yea, sometimes its difficult to just get out of work."

8942,continuation,"Although its easy to get burned at the beach, its well worth it."
8943,elaboration,You just have to use protection and deal with the sand
8944,joking_sarcastic,"Well, there is sand and sun at the beach. Those things kinda happen."
8945,change,I love being out in the warm sun.
8946,continuation,"Yea, we used to go camping in New Jersey."
8947,elaboration,"Yea, there are lots of great beaches out there."
8948,joking_sarcastic,Who wouldn't wanna sleep on the sand?
8949,change,Its fun being able to enjoy the summer
8950,continuation,That sounds like a good summer look. You might wanna use sunscreen.
8951,elaboration,You may want to use sunscreen and different shoes.
8952,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, that sounds like the description of the clown next down."
8953,change,I love sitting in the sun.
8954,continuation,"yea, the only  good part about the cold is that you can put on a Jacket."

8961,change,Lets just enjoy life!`

8965,change,I just love being able to enjoy time relaxing.
8966,continuation,The mountains can be very relaxing.
8967,elaboration,"Yea, I love being somewhere where few people are."
8968,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, nothing like being alone on a mountain"
8969,change,"I was reading an article that said that ""mindfulness"" meditation has a lot of benefits for your brain."
8970,continuation,"It's such as shame that it can be an ordeal getting there and back, though, that takes something away from it."
8971,elaboration,If there was a way to get the peacefulness and the serenity without the hassles that would be great. But I think whatever they'd do to make that work would mess up the good parts.
8972,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, but after being cooped up in the car with my kids getting there I NEED some mediation."
8973,change,"Well, I'm relaxed just being here."
8974,continuation,"Yea, we can get some pizza and enjoy that by the pizza."
8975,elaboration,We can also listen to the whiff of the ball from the kids going past us.
8976,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, thats really relaxing.... NOT"
8977,change,I never really watch movies.
8978,continuation,Please don't put that thought into my head.
8979,elaboration,"Yea, the shark made you think you are going to get eaten."
8980,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, you might get eaten."

8982,continuation,It's only a fifteen minute walk!
8983,elaboration,"Sometimes, depending on traffic and time of day."
8984,joking_sarcastic,"Nope, you can make it with a 3-wood."
8985,change,I know. Cleaning the car is almost as time consuming as shampooing the carpet.
8986,continuation,Yes. I normally just use the shop vac and clean everything at once. It saves time that way.
8987,elaboration,"Yeah sand can really damage carpet over time, too."
8988,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, car washes should have a ""beach clean"" package."
8989,change,I know! Have you been to the new water park? The wave pool is awesome.
8990,continuation,I know. The entire experience is unforgettable. Waves are the best part.
8991,elaboration,I think I prefer the beach to lakes.
8992,joking_sarcastic,"Awww, you remind me of a dolphin. Except for the intelligent part."
8993,change,What time you going?
8994,continuation,Oh it is not fun at all!
8995,elaboration,Sunburns always turn into tans though.
8996,joking_sarcastic,Oh my hope you don't get cold.
8997,change,I had the opportunity but decided to go kitesurfing instead. Have you done that?
8998,continuation,"I have, but just on a guided kayak tour."
8999,elaboration,"I haven't, but I've heard it's kind of dangerous."
9000,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, but I think HipMunk is better."
9001,change,"Rivers are so much better than lakes. I think the rushing water is better on a hot day, than stagnant water."
9002,continuation,"I've stepped on a few things that squishes before, but nothing that I could tell what it was. I'm more afraid of parasites."
9003,elaboration,You really have to wear tennis shoes of some sort to not get gashed by broken bottles at some lakes.
9004,joking_sarcastic,"Haha, I imagine you going to the lake and you see this shark fin."
9005,change,I love to jump in pools.
9006,continuation,"Yea, it is thrilling and especially fun if you're good."
9007,elaboration,"Yea, its great! I love being on the water."
9008,joking_sarcastic,Unless you get eaten by a shark. Then it sucks.
9009,change,I like to go on boats.
9010,continuation,"Yea, smooth lakes are fun."

9016,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I just love getting sea sick."
9017,change,Nothing is more beautiful than seeing the leaves change. Fall is my favorite season.
9018,continuation,Pattle boards are a lot of fun but you'd be surprised how much they cost.
9019,elaboration,I've always loved the cool mountain air. It feels cleaner than city air.
9020,joking_sarcastic,It's beautiful for a couple of months and then everything and everyone freezes. It's like walking into a freezer at the grocery store.
9021,change,We should rent jet skis for a lake instead of paddle boards.
9022,continuation,I would be down. It is a great upper body workout to go on paddle boards.
9023,elaboration,"I do not know of any that rent them out, but I am sure we can find out where online."
9024,joking_sarcastic,Yeah right I would not be able to stand on a paddle board for more than a minute.
9025,change,We should plan a canoe trip for ourselves and our kids.
9026,continuation,I have never been canoeing other than once at camp.
9027,elaboration,I did like paddling in the quiet. I'd love to go again.
9028,joking_sarcastic,My bunk mates weren't such good paddlers. They decided to swim instead and tipped their canoes so they could.
9029,change,"I like camping, but I would rather have a camper, not a tent. I like having a door to close at night."
9030,continuation,Where is your favorite place to camp?
9031,elaboration,Would you rather camp by a lake or by the ocean? I'm sure you pack differently for each one.
9032,joking_sarcastic,You love the bugs and bears too?!
9033,change,"Speaking of summer, once my kids are out of school we're thinking of taking them on an old-school road trip to see some sights."
9034,continuation,"When I was a kid, a friend of the family had a summer house up on the lake and sometimes they'd invite us up. Hanging out on their boat was always the best part."
9035,elaboration,"It's so peaceful on a boat, kind of like a separate world you can step onto for a little while."
9036,joking_sarcastic,"It's also nice for spending time with enemies, one quick push and they're over the side never to be seen again."
9037,change,I also like water slides but you obviously have to go somewhere special for those.
9038,continuation,Do you still enjoy tubing? You used to go all the time.
9039,elaboration,I remember when we went to your uncle's house and went tubing. You fell off the tube. It was hilarious.
9040,joking_sarcastic,"You only fell during tubing because you were anxious to go swimming, though, right?"
9041,change,I love boating.
9042,continuation,"Yea, well its kinda hard to go on a lake without a boat?"
9043,elaboration,Why do you go on a lake without a boat?
9044,joking_sarcastic,Lake water isn't the cleanest ya know?
9045,change,Have you been back to Lake Lattimore with your kids?
9046,continuation,I remember when he took us to Lake Lattimore. That was so much fun.
9047,elaboration,We caught tons of fish. He made us a big fish supper.
9048,joking_sarcastic,You hated fish but ate more than either of us.
9049,change,Sometimes instead of fishing I'd just go around the shore hunting for frogs with the fishing net.
9050,continuation,"Most of the time we would just fish from the shore, but it was still pretty cool."
9051,elaboration,We had a little rowboat that we would take sometimes. Honestly I had more fun rowing the boat than I did with the fishing.
9052,joking_sarcastic,Are you sure you're remembering fishing and not the intro to Gilligan's Island?
9053,change,"Yeah, did you ever want to dive into large bodies of water? I get heebie jeebies whenever I imagine falling out of a boat. High diving is just creepy."
9054,continuation,"Awww, I remember fishing as a kid."
9055,elaboration,I bet he thought you were really cute when you freaked out about the fish biting.
9056,joking_sarcastic,Imagine what would happen if you reeled in a boot.
9057,change,I love to travel anywhere that I can.
9058,continuation,"Well, you can gain a lot of weight that way."
9059,elaboration,"Yea, the food is usually really good and if you haven't tried the deserts, you should."
9060,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, why not stuff yourself to the gills."
9061,change,I just love having the time to relax.
9062,continuation,That is the nicest and most relaxing feeling.
9063,elaboration,"Yea, I love just sitting by the blue water and relaxing."
9064,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, it makes me wanna take a shower right after."
9065,change,I just love having my feet in the sand.
9066,continuation,"Yea, standing on that board is just peaceful."
9067,elaboration,"Yea, theres something about being on the board in the ocean."
9068,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, especially when I fall off every second."
9069,change,"Mexico sounds nice, but I'd rather wake up somewhere in Europe on a beach. Have you ever traveled to any European beaches?"
9070,continuation,If you wake up in Mexico you would have had to have slept for a solid 20+ hours!
9071,elaboration,"The beaches in Mexico are beautiful! Warm clear water, white sand, and great weather. I've always wanted to go to Cancun, Mexico."
9072,joking_sarcastic,Well if you wake up in Mexico at least there's plenty of new beaches to explore!
9073,change,"Yea, going to the beach is fun anytime."
9074,continuation,That will be fun. What beach will you take them to?
9075,elaboration,Thats really good! Having kids to take to the beach is fun.
9076,joking_sarcastic,You mean you actually want kids?
9077,change,Everybody has to get old someday.

9079,elaboration,"Yea, the kid in me still has a lot of energy though."
9080,joking_sarcastic,"Sucks getting old, doesn't it."
9081,change,"Well, the midwest is a  nice place still."
9082,continuation,"Yea, the midwest has mostly grass."
9083,elaboration,"Yea, you had more farms than anything then."
9084,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, did you guys ever leave the farm?"
9085,change,The beach is really a lot of fun with so many things to do or see.
9086,continuation,Don't you love it when you find some cool shell when you're walking on the beach?
9087,elaboration,"Yes, but I have to say my favorite beach day is when it is kind of foggy out and you can hear fog horns in the distance . The surf is crashing and there is barely anyone around. It is so peaceful and almost zen-like."
9088,joking_sarcastic,I bet you see a lot of hot guys on that kind of day!
9089,change,I sure like to sleep as much as I can.
9090,continuation,"Yea, I've been. They can work if you just relax and enjoy them."
9091,elaboration,"Yea, I've heard that professional athletes use stuff like that."
9092,joking_sarcastic,Just go to sleep the natural way.
9093,change,I love variety when shopping.
9094,continuation,"Yea, I think it is a fun activity."
9095,elaboration,"Yea, a little variety is always nice."
9096,joking_sarcastic,I love variety in all things.
9097,change,I prefer listening to a gentle brook to relax.
9098,continuation,"And thinking how much water there is on the horizon makes me feel small, too."
9099,elaboration,The sound makes me feel relaxed. The whoosh is very soothing.
9100,joking_sarcastic,"No this is the ocean sounding big: ""HI I'M THE OCEAN!"""
9101,change,"Ha, you know what? At work I just had to do a training on mediation. Very different."
9102,continuation,"It seems like that's the big thing right now, I see so many articles about mindfulness."
9103,elaboration,"I've always been a little skeptical of meditation, it reminds me of hokey New Age stuff."
9104,joking_sarcastic,"Here's a koan: learning involves filling your mind, but meditation involves emptying your mind, so how can you learn to meditate?"
9105,change,You know I've heard that we've maybe gone too far in terms of protecting ourselves from the sun and as a result our bodies don't get as much vitamin D as they need.
9106,continuation,I know what you mean. My skin is so sensitive to the sun that I turn into a lobster before I even realize I'm burning if I'm not careful.
9107,elaboration,Yeah. And when I'm applying sunscreen it tends to just make me more anxious because it gets me all paranoid about skin cancer.
9108,joking_sarcastic,That's why you need to get someone to bury you in the sand first. And if it's someone nice they'll even do it above the high tide line.
9109,change,I just like relaxing by anything that is calm.
9110,continuation,"Yea, well lots of movement something causes relaxation too."
9111,elaboration,"Yea, as long as the movement is relaxing, its okay."

9115,elaboration,"Yea, we do a lot of good, but sure do some bad as well."
9116,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, us humans are the worst."
9117,change,I could stare at my boyfriend all day long.
9118,continuation,"I agree. There is nothing quite like sitting in a lawn chair with your toes in the sand, staring at the water like that."
9119,elaboration,"I know! I prefer rivers to beaches, though. The water ripples so beautifully."
9120,joking_sarcastic,"Just don't fall in, haha."
9121,change,"I find beaches can be a bit crowded sometimes. I've never relaxed by a lake, have you ever done that?"
9122,continuation,I also find watching sailboats from a distance quite soothing.
9123,elaboration,"I only been on one a couple of times, but I really enjoyed being on a sailboat."
9124,joking_sarcastic,I guess the only annoying sound you can hear on the beach sometimes is all the kids screaming!
9125,change,"No, but we've got something nice planned for Christmas!"
9126,continuation,Not this year but we'll try relaxing in the mountains.
9127,elaboration,"Just had a baby, so no vacations for a while!"
9128,joking_sarcastic,I've been banned from all beaches after the Shark Fin incident.
9129,change,"Do you usually bring food with you, or do you buy stuff there?"
9130,continuation,"Yeah, they act like they own the place! Well, they are called seagulls and it is the sea, maybe they've got some sort of claim."
9131,elaboration,They're so annoying up close. That's part of why I'm usually hesitant to bring food when I go.
9132,joking_sarcastic,You should turn the tables on them and steal some of the garbage they eat.
9133,change,"I got a pedometer because I thought it would help motivate me to walk more, but mostly it's just keeping track of how few steps I've taken."
9134,continuation,Would noise-cancelling headphones work? I haven't tried them myself but I've been meaning to.
9135,elaboration,"I know what you mean, it's so hard to escape from the hustle and bustle of civilization."
9136,joking_sarcastic,I wonder what the people who invented cars would think if they knew we need them so we can get far enough away from other cars to walk in peace.
9137,change,"Well, nobody hates being at the beach."
9138,continuation,"Yea, they are really beautiful and are a joy to watch."
9139,elaboration,"Yea, they crash on the shore and are fun."
9140,joking_sarcastic,"Yea, I love hearing the same noise over and over."

9143,elaboration,"Yea, I hate a busy beach."
9144,joking_sarcastic,"Eh, the more the merrier."
9145,change,I like to go in any water I can find.
9146,continuation,Sometimes its nice to be able to dry off and go right home.
9147,elaboration,"Yea, I agree. Sometimes the sand is too much to deal with."
9148,joking_sarcastic,Are you just too lazy to shower?
9149,change,I like to put shells on my wall.
9150,continuation,Did you listen to more than one at a time?
9151,elaboration,Did you feel like you heard the ocean in them?
9152,joking_sarcastic,"When you listened to them, did they listen to you?"
9153,change,i just like getting my feet wet.
9154,continuation,Big waves are the best kind of waves.
9155,elaboration,I love experiencing the thrill of big waves hitting me.
9156,joking_sarcastic,I just love being tackled by waves.
9157,change,I wonder what other objects have unique sounds when held to the ear.
9158,continuation,I know you're not supposed to take shells from the beach but it's so cool to bring the sound of the ocean home with you. I had to study why it sounds that way but can't remember what I learned.
9159,elaboration,"I agree about all the sand, that's why I always have a shop vac at the ready when I get home."
9160,joking_sarcastic,If you get enough sand in your car you can let the little ones play in the floorboards!
9161,change,"I remember that one time I thought a shark touched me and it was just some seaweed, but I went running out of the water screaming anyway."
9162,continuation,Me too. But even when it's warm it cools you down on a hot day.
9163,elaboration,Every beach I go is always super cold when I first go in!
9164,joking_sarcastic,"Better than stepping into a warm spot in a pool, am I right?"
9165,change,"Oh gosh, that reminds me of the time I got sunburned at the beach."
9166,continuation,Beaches are just the ultimate getaway.
9167,elaboration,"Have you ever surfed? I'm too afraid of dying, haha."
9168,joking_sarcastic,Well they make this thing called flip flops...
9169,change,Too much stuff to do and i want to relax myself right ?
9170,continuation,I know I went on a trip to a rental house on the coast and it was very peaceful and relaxing to hear the waves at night.
9171,elaboration,Oh do you have trouble sleeping at times? I do too
9172,joking_sarcastic,"No I want to hear them for sure, better than the loud cars"
9173,change,I love finding seaglass. I've looked for seaglass on the beach with my mom since I was a little kid.
9174,continuation,That's awesome! I love it when I find a shell I can hear the ocean through.
9175,elaboration,It's like you get to take a memory of each beach home with you. That's why I love collecting seashells.
9176,joking_sarcastic,"I'm always so worried that a crab will be in a seashell I come across, and it will bite my finger off or something!"
9177,change,I like taking long rides in the car.
9178,continuation,"Yea, its a tough thing to get out of the car."
9179,elaboration,"Yea, I don't like doing that either. No matter what you do, it will still be there."

9185,change,I think the mountains are so much prettier when it's cold.

9187,elaboration,I bet it would be so epic to see snow at the beach.
9188,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, nothing beats having an icicle hanging off your nose while you try to splash in frozen water."
9189,change,You d have to worry about your carbon emissions  to combat global warming ...  Can you believe people still believe in that bunk ?
9190,continuation,I was on a boat once . The day after I got married. My one and only boat experience
9191,elaboration,I don't know if thats a good idea. They are a lot of upkeep and dont have much resale value

9193,change,I love being on the beach any chance i get.
9194,continuation,"Yea, I love feeling the sand beneath my toes."

9201,change,"Do you remember the seagulls from Finding Nemo? That whole ""mine?"" ""mine?"" bit was so spot-on."
9202,continuation,"Well walking on sand is all strength-training for your feet and calves, you need to mix it up if you want speed and agility."
9203,elaboration,"Ha ha. It would be nice to be able to get rid of them, though. They're so annoying! When I bring food I always feel like I need to watch out so they don't try to steal it."
9204,joking_sarcastic,"Well, using Mr. Miyagi's training method, I think what you need to do is start opening bottles with your feet, and then when you go for the seagulls your muscle memory will kick in."
9205,change,I love reading magazines.
9206,continuation,"Yea, they usually have good listings."
9207,elaboration,"Yea, you should definitely look at other countries too!"
9208,joking_sarcastic,Oh yea? I thought they featured food.
9209,change,Okay let's stop talking about poop. Since we're at the beach do you wanna go get some poop-free boardwalk fries?
9210,continuation,That reminds of when I went to Ocean City. The beach was so full of tourist trash it was hard to enjoy it.
9211,elaboration,"Well, when you think about it... the ocean is also full of poop. Fish poop too you know."

10243,positive,There are alot of elderly people in great shape over at the pool!  I see them pumping in the gym before they go out for a swim.

10249,rhetorical,Wouldn't anyone like to be that fit at 80?
10250,change,"Of course, the beach isn't the only place I'd like to live. I bet waking up and seeing the sun rise above the mountains would be pretty interesting too, don't you think?"
10251,continuation,Seeing the sun glisten on the water as it rises must be sort of magical as you smell that sweet morning breeze.
10252,elaboration,"I've never lived near a beach, so I've never had the chance to see the sun rise over the water. So the idea is really appealing to me."
10253,joking_sarcastic,"And plus, you know, I hear the dawn is the best time to meet mermaids. Maybe during one of my morning strolls I'll come across a cute girl swimming nearby, and I'll hook up with her. I'll just have to try and ignore the tail."
10254,change,I don't just love walking on the beach though. I like hiking through all kinds of natural areas. I once was strolling through the forest and found a neat cave system. You ever been spelunking?
10255,continuation,"You get to sea the ocean, pick up seashells, enjoy the scent of the fresh ocean air. It's just a great all around experience, honestly."
10256,elaboration,"Of course I don't mean that everyone literally loves walks on the beach. Some people probably don't, but I think most people would enjoy all the different things that the beach has to offer. And in this case, even just walking is great because you get to take in the beauty of the land."
10257,joking_sarcastic,"Me? I personally take a Hoveround. Don't want my feet touching that nasty sand. Who knows what's in it? Crabs, eels, probably filled with sea monsters and bacterias. No thank you, I'd rather be a lazy shit."

10259,continuation,"I know.  It's so nice to have the fresh, salty air in your hair."

10261,joking_sarcastic,The only people who don't like walks on the beach are people you can't trust.
10262,change,"But you know, IT companies aren't the only groups that want to try and control everything. The government isn't that much better, what with the NSA spying and all that. It's hard to know who we can trust now days. I mostly just trust family and friends."
10263,continuation,"Soon they'll have more powerful than the government, that is, unless of course the government had them install backdoors into everything and they're listening in, too."
10264,elaboration,"The IT companies want to gather information about everything about us. What we like, what we dislike, how many friends we have, and so on. Then they can sell that information to other companies and advertisers. Everyone will have to rely on them to get what they need. After all, information is power, and he who controls information is a powerful man indeed."
10265,joking_sarcastic,"Think about it! They'll know all the times know all the kinds of porn we like, and when we like to watch it! They'll bombard us with popups and trick us into watching it constantly; getting us hooked on new perversions! Then no one will ever go outside, so no one will be able to stop them! It's the perfect plan, isn't it? As long as they their systems don't hook them, too."
10266,change,"So be careful out there. You wouldn't want to get hurt. If you did, you'd have to go to the hospital, and it seems like insurance costs are rising sky high lately."
10267,continuation,"Oh, and your breaks. Never know when something could go wrong with those. Actually, it's a good idea to get your whole car checked out, and the locks on your doors too."
10268,elaboration,"I mean, the world is a dangerous place, you never know who's out to get you, or how they'll do it. It never hurts to be cautious. It never hurts to be prepared even if 99% of the time everything is just fine. Gotta stay safe, man."
10269,joking_sarcastic,"Break open your condoms to make sure there are no microchips in there. Those things will collect your sperm and upload them to the internet to create a race of anatomically correct super digital clone men! I mean, they won't do much, 'cause they'll be stuck online, but it'll be weird."
10270,change,"I guess it doesn't matter. Those things don't work half the time anyway, so they probably aren't listening. You know what else never seems to work half the time? Cellphones these days. Seems like every one I get breaks on me. What kind of phone do you use?"
10271,continuation,"As long as you're friend isn't threatening their companies, or society or whatever, I think it'll be alright.  That's assuming they're even listening at all. He's probably just being paranoid."
10272,elaboration,"You don't think he's threatening anyone, or plotting a bombing or anything like that right? I guess the NSA or FBI or whoever might be scared of that, even if you're joking. Or if he's talking about switching toa different company or system, or something. Yeah, that sort of thing might make the manufacturer nervous as well."
10273,joking_sarcastic,"Unless he's got a bunch of middle school kids tied up in his basement that are screaming to get out, I don't think he has much to worry about. And even if he does, their screams will be so muffled by the time they get to the listening devices, they probably won't even hear!"
10274,change,"It seems like this is the way things are going, though. Maybe in a few years it will be like cell phones and it will seem weird to NOT have them."
10275,continuation,"I mean obviously they ARE listening, because otherwise how would they know that you're talking to them? But they're supposed to just ignore it unless it's relevant to what they're programmed to respond to."
10276,elaboration,"It's probably no big deal. But then you hear about how the NSA just has a giant database of intercepted conversations and you start to wonder whether they'd be able to collect what these things hear, too, you know?"
10277,joking_sarcastic,It would be convenient for when I need the pod bay doors opened.
10278,change,Do you wanna get a pizza?
10279,continuation,I prefer the paper. You can form a better opinion when you're reading it alone.
10280,elaboration,I can't stand the news on the television. I do not like news anchors.
10281,joking_sarcastic,"Yeah, news people are boring."
10282,change,"Anyway, I don't read the newspaper much. I prefer to read books instead. Sci-fi novels and non-fiction mostly. Are there any specific kinds of books you read?"
10283,continuation,"The ink is all runny, and you can't even tell what the pictures are of anymore. How am I supposed to enjoy reading a bunch of smudgy blobs?"
10284,elaboration,"Though, if I'm being honest, even when it's not wet outside the newspaper isn't my favorite way to read about the news. It's great for local stuff, but everything else you could read online as the story develops. News in newspapers is usually a bit dated, and the news you can get online is free."
10285,joking_sarcastic,"Still, it's better than watching those late night talk shows where they go, ""Did you hear about this? The president is a moron. He did a really stupid thing today. Gave away classified information, because he's so dumb. That's the joke. He's an idiot. And I'm explaining it because he's so stupid, he wouldn't understand it otherwise!"", you know? So original. What a great way to get your news."
10286,change,"Oh well, I guess industries die and start up all the time. Who knows where they'll end up. If you could end up working in a different industry, what would you like to be doing?"
10287,continuation,All those jobs lost. I wonder where all the reporters and newspaper editors will end up. Maybe they'll have to get jobs in TV too?
10288,elaboration,"Of course, it's not just newspapers. The entire paper industry is dying. It's been going for years, little by little. No one wants to read paper books when they can get them electronically on their tablets. And no one wants to buy newspapers when they can read news on Facebook for free. The death of these industries is inevitable."
10289,joking_sarcastic,"With all those leftover, unsold newspapers, I'll be able to build myself a paper house, paper clothes, and a giant bonfire to keep myself warm. I'll be set for life! I'll be like a superhero; Paperman. My power is that I selfishly hoard old newspapers and use them for mundane tasks!"
10290,change,"Personally, I have no problem with getting your news with a dose of entertainment, but I prefer to get my news from Vloggers instead. Their opinions seem more real to me. I just feel like I'm able to relate to them somehow, you know?"
10291,continuation,It's all about having someone regurgitate the day's topics that everyone who has already glanced at trending news section anywhere on the internet has already heard.
10292,elaboration,"No one seems to care about humor, or celebrities anymore. It's not about watching interesting interviews, or hearing neat little anecdotes. People just want to dose off while feeling like they're informed about stuff."
10293,joking_sarcastic,"I mean, I could watch a serious, in-depth program about the news like Frontline for free on PBS, or I could watch highlights from last night's monologue by Jimmy ""Everyone In Late Night TV Is Named Jimmy"" Bland-Middle-America so I have something to talk about with my coworkers over lunch so I can feel like I'm in the know about things! Look at me! I'm smart and topical! Hurhurhur!"
10294,change,"It's not even good humor. If you want to see real humor, I suggest going to the movies. Have you seen any good comedies lately?"
10295,continuation,"I understand that people like their comedy to be topical, but I think it's too much. What ever happened to absurdist stylings? Or just being funny to be funny?"
10296,elaboration,"People want to laugh, but they also want to feel smart. They want to feel like they're learning, and being informed. So they kill two birds with one stone, even if most of these late night TV shows aren't good examples of news or humor."
10297,joking_sarcastic,"Maybe this is just the start. Maybe everything will be a joke? Maybe we'll wake up one day and find out that the president has ordered a nuclear first strike 'cause he thought it was funny. At least the late night comedians would be out of a job then. Not just because everything would be one big joke, but 'cause, you know... They'd be dead."
10298,change,"You would think manufacturing would provide most of the driving power behind the economy. But I guess those jobs are leaving due to automation. Robots really are the future. Maybe we'll even see people getting robot pets, or marrying robots, huh?"
10299,continuation,"They go to a few stores, stay in a few hotels, eat a few restaurants, and bam, somehow they're the driving force behind the entire economy."
10300,elaboration,"It's crazy to think that a bunch of people who don't even live in the area, who may not even speak the language, somehow provide for everyone who lives there. Without these visitors, who will never stay for long, and truly appreciate the way of life for the people who live there, everything would go belly-up and the locals would have to move."
10301,joking_sarcastic,"Tourists really do have all the power since they run the whole economy. They ought to demand ought to demand the royal treatment! ""Bring me your best wine and virgins, for I am your new god for the next two weeks, and a couple hours before I have to leave for the airport!"""
10302,change,"But speaking of getting away to places, I've been meaning to get down to the store and buy some new clothes. I've been wearing the same stuff for years, and it's time I got something new. What do you think I should get? IS there anything particular in style right now?"
10303,continuation,"You get to go somewhere else, be someone else, and just enjoy yourself. It's the greatest feeling in the world."
10304,elaboration,"Everyone needs a break from the stresses and monotony of everyday life. When you travel, for a brief moment you can push worries of your life away pretend you have no responsibilities."
10305,joking_sarcastic,"It's like being an angel! Or in my case, a demon, since when I travel I always get my fun from going around and sabotaging everyone else's enjoyment and just being a huge ass! I actually have a devil I wear and everything. We should vacation together, I'll show you."
10306,change,"I can't even tell you all the amazing places I've visited. Some of them aren't even real. I've been into VR lately, and using it to visit virtual destinations. Have you tried VR yet?"
10307,continuation,"I love going to new places, seeing new people, trying new foods. The entire experience is what makes life worth living. I don't know how I'd get by without travel."
10308,elaboration,"It's always been my lifelong goal to travel the world. It's basically my biggest aspiration. To travel to every continent, excluding Antarctica of course. I want to visit all the major cities in the world, and lots of small hidden locations too. I guess I just want to see it all, and experience everything."
10309,joking_sarcastic,"The moment I get too old to travel I will literally die then and there. I will just fall over dead, so that I can travel to my next and final destination. I wonder where I'll end up. Guess I'll still have one surprise to look forward to!"
10310,change,Do you think you could ever live in Asia?
10311,continuation,"I don't know if I would want to live there.  I like to travel, but I also like coming back home."
10312,elaboration,"I think I would like living in Italy the most.  The food, the history, and the people are all so interesting to me."
10313,joking_sarcastic,The Europeans that come to America?
10314,Prompt,"What is something you have always wanted, but could not have due to social stigmas?"
10315,General Response,Probably a girlfriend. I mean I dont think Im really like that but its interesting to say the least but I think it would affect my family too much to be worth it
10316,Prompt,"What is something you have always wanted, but could not have due to social stigmas?"
10317,General Response,"I can't think of anything in particular, but generally speaking I wanted the benefits of equality with men, but social stigmas don't allow that."
10318,Prompt,"What is something you have always wanted, but could not have due to social stigmas?"
10319,General Response,I have always wanted to walk naked wherever I may please. I would enjoy feeling liberated but understand the legality of the issue.
10320,Prompt,"What is something you have always wanted, but could not have due to social stigmas?"
10321,General Response,"There are dark moments in my marriage where I wished that I had a child without needing a partner. Marriage is such a trial sometimes. It is not an easy endeavor. I think it is more detrimental to a person than parenthood. Being a parent has many more positives that outweigh the negatives, which are really just challenges that make you a better person. Marriage can really displace your person or set you up for failure. It can be very difficult to recover from."
10322,Prompt,"What is something you have always wanted, but could not have due to social stigmas?"
10323,General Response,"I always wanted a black friend. But, I never really had one. I have some online, but never a close black friend."
10324,Prompt,Which recent news story is the most interesting?
10325,General Response,The most recent news story on President Trump and his new shenanigans in white house is the most interesting.
10326,Prompt,Which recent news story is the most interesting?
10327,General Response,The fighting between the Democrats and Republicans and how the democrats still cant accept who is running the country now and the changes taking place. I didnt vote for either of them but lets ban together to make a difference.
10328,Prompt,Which recent news story is the most interesting?
10329,General Response,I think its interesting how they are making college tuition free for some individuals
10330,Prompt,Which recent news story is the most interesting?
10331,General Response,That the antarctic shelf is breaking is a sure sign of climate change and there are still people in denial.
10332,Prompt,Which recent news story is the most interesting?
10333,General Response,"The most recent news story is whether President Trump will be impeached or found guilty of any crimes.  Cable news stations cover this constantly, so it is something on my mind daily."
10334,Prompt,Would you rather be poor and attractive or rich and ugly?
10335,General Response,I'd rather be rich and ugly because money can take care of my looks if I really cared about that.
10336,Prompt,Would you rather be poor and attractive or rich and ugly?
10337,General Response,"Hmmm...good question. I think I'd rather be rich and ugly. Plastic surgery could fix that. If not, at least I could would have all the things money could buy to make myself happy."
10338,Prompt,Would you rather be poor and attractive or rich and ugly?
10339,General Response,"I'd rather be rich and ugly.  Money can fix ugly, and it makes life easier in the long run."

10342,Prompt,Would you rather be poor and attractive or rich and ugly?
10343,General Response,"This is a hard one. I guess rich, because you could always have surgery to look more attractive."
10344,Prompt,Would you rather have one wish granted today or three wishes granted ten years from now?
10345,General Response,I would rather have three wishes granted to me ten years from now. This gives me ten years to think about how to spend my only three wishes. This will also allow me create wishes that are concrete and valuable to me.
10346,Prompt,Would you rather have one wish granted today or three wishes granted ten years from now?
10347,General Response,I would rather have one wish granted today because I feel like it would be more useful than waiting for ten years when I may not even be around.
10348,Prompt,Would you rather have one wish granted today or three wishes granted ten years from now?
10349,General Response,I will wait for the three wishes in ten years. If I make a wish today and in ten years something comes up like a disease or poverty then I would wish I had my wish back.
10350,Prompt,Would you rather have one wish granted today or three wishes granted ten years from now?
10351,General Response,I think I would rather have one wish granted today because I don't know what my life would be like in 10 years.
10352,Prompt,Would you rather have one wish granted today or three wishes granted ten years from now?
10353,General Response,I would rather have one wish granted today than waiting for ten years because  i can enjoy my life more
10354,Prompt,Would you rather not be able to read or not be able to write?
10355,General Response,I would have to choose reading.  There would not be much to write about if we couldn't read to begin with!
10356,Prompt,Would you rather not be able to read or not be able to write?
10357,General Response,"I would rather not be able to write since I can still read and talk about things verbally. In todays world, with smart phones I can simply talk my words into text that does not me require me to write or type anything."
10358,Prompt,Would you rather not be able to read or not be able to write?
10359,General Response,I would rather not be able to read because I cannot imagine not being able to write music.
10360,Prompt,Would you rather not be able to read or not be able to write?
10361,General Response,I would rather not be able to write but be able to read. I enjoy reading and these days I rarely write.
10362,Prompt,Would you rather not be able to read or not be able to write?
10363,General Response,"I would rather not be able to write than not be able to read.  With technology these days, there is speech to text and other things that make actually writing almost obsolete anyway."
10364,Prompt,"Would you rather give a speech to the whole school, including teachers, for 30 minutes or work in the school cafeteria for a semester?"
10365,General Response,"I have no problem talking in front of others, and I tend to tell very embellished stories. However, I have to choose the school cafeteria on this one. Think of all the free food samples!"
10366,Prompt,"Would you rather give a speech to the whole school, including teachers, for 30 minutes or work in the school cafeteria for a semester?"
10367,General Response,"i would rather give a speech to the whole school, including teachers, for 30 minutes. i never really liked school that much"
10368,Prompt,"Would you rather give a speech to the whole school, including teachers, for 30 minutes or work in the school cafeteria for a semester?"
10369,General Response,"Working in the cafeteria can't be that bad, giving a speech to the school would take a whole lot of work and testicular fortitude."
10370,Prompt,"Would you rather give a speech to the whole school, including teachers, for 30 minutes or work in the school cafeteria for a semester?"
10371,General Response,I'd rather work in the school cafeteria for a semester. I hate speeches so much. Public speaking classes were a nightmare.
10372,Prompt,"Would you rather give a speech to the whole school, including teachers, for 30 minutes or work in the school cafeteria for a semester?"
10373,General Response,I think that I would prefer honestly the school cafeteria because I would rather work in the cafeteria then deal with my stage fright..
10374,Prompt,Would you rather be rich and alone or be poor and find true love?
10375,General Response,"I would rather be poor and find true love. Being poor is a situation I can overcome. I might not ever become rich, but I would have the things that really count in life: True love, caring, dedication, devotion, companionship. My husband and I would be able to find ways to survive financially. It might not be easy but it would be worth it. 

Being rich and alone would  be harder. You would begin to hate people because you would realize that people don't truly care for you, only what you can give them or do for them. 

There is a chance that being poor and having your true love wouldn't work out either. A lot of couples, who truly love each other, fight and break up over money issues. Lack of money to take care of one's loved ones can change a person's personality. How many horror stories have been on the news about a spouse that committed domestic violence, or even murder and it is said about that person that they used to be a wonderful person until losing their job or financial troubles began and they started drinking or doing drugs. 

Human beings need love and companionship. Now that is not to say I wouldn't prefer being Rich and having my True love together. We would be able to accomplish so much more in life and help others."
10376,Prompt,Would you rather be rich and alone or be poor and find true love?
10377,General Response,I would rather be poor and find true love because companionship is more important to me than any monetary value.
10378,Prompt,Would you rather be rich and alone or be poor and find true love?
10379,General Response,"Better to be rich and have a nice home and plentiful food, and money probably can buy happiness."
10380,Prompt,Would you rather be rich and alone or be poor and find true love?
10381,General Response,"I would rather be rich and alone. I have found that true love is overrated and you can never overrate money. Also, money can buy you love."
10382,Prompt,Would you rather be rich and alone or be poor and find true love?
10383,General Response,"I think poor, but it really depends on how poor. There's a lot of suffering that happens to people because of the lack of money."
10384,Prompt,I am genuinely interested. What is one song you will never skip on your playlist?
10385,General Response,"I am still addicted to ""Shut up and Dance"" by Walk the Moon. It was a song of the summer a few years ago and every time it comes on it puts me in a good mood."
10386,Prompt,I am genuinely interested. What is one song you will never skip on your playlist?
10387,General Response,"Stockholm Syndrome by Muse. It starts out so strong, and has no parts that drag, so it grabs me every time."
10388,Prompt,I am genuinely interested. What is one song you will never skip on your playlist?
10389,General Response,"The one song I will never skip is ""In Memory of Elizabeth Reed"" by the Allman Brothers because it never gets old no many how many times I've heard it."
10390,Prompt,I am genuinely interested. What is one song you will never skip on your playlist?
10391,General Response,The one song i will never skip on my playlist is Said i loved you by Michael Bolton because it is very nostalgic
10392,Prompt,I am genuinely interested. What is one song you will never skip on your playlist?
10393,General Response,"It may be funny, but I can never skip Mc Hammer's ""U can't Touch This"". It has a great beat, and is fun to listen to."
10394,Prompt,"Kale, super food or overrated lettuce?"
10395,General Response,I honestly am not a person to much into vegetables. So i would have to say its overrated lettuce. I think it all tastes the same.
10396,Prompt,"Kale, super food or overrated lettuce?"
10397,General Response,It's definitely a super food compared to lettuce. Lettuce has nearly no nutritional value and is essentially just plant flavored water.
10398,Prompt,"Kale, super food or overrated lettuce?"
10399,General Response,It is definitely an overrated lettuce. It's disgusting and there's nothing super about it in my opinion.
10400,Prompt,"Kale, super food or overrated lettuce?"
10401,General Response,"Kale has a lot of vitamins and minerals, but those vitamins and minerals won't help you if you're not deficient. However, kale is delicious when used in a good recipe."
10402,Prompt,"Kale, super food or overrated lettuce?"
10403,General Response,I think calling Kale overrated lettuce is an insult to lettuce. Nothing short of it curing cancer would convince me Kale is worthy of being used for anything other than a decoration. I am immediately suspicious of anyone claiming to enjoy Kale.
10404,Prompt,What is the most embarrassing piece of clothing you own?
10405,General Response,Well I'm a stripper so are you sure you want to ask that question?
10406,Prompt,What is the most embarrassing piece of clothing you own?

10408,Prompt,What is the most embarrassing piece of clothing you own?
10409,General Response,"I have this pair of underwear that is extremely small, and I am a male. They do NOT fit too well."
10410,Prompt,What is the most embarrassing piece of clothing you own?
10411,General Response,"I do own a big cowboy hat, and some may say that would be an embarrassing item to wear."
10412,Prompt,What is the most embarrassing piece of clothing you own?
10413,General Response,"It's a jacket i used to wear a lot, modeled after the assassins creed game. I used to like it but now it's my least favorite piece of clothing, if you ever get to see it i want you tell me if it was ugly as i thought it was."
10414,Prompt,Talk about some of the interesting people you have met while traveling.
10415,General Response,I've met a lot of funny and kind people while traveling. Friendly ones that feed you too much and want you to stay with them longer.
10416,Prompt,Talk about some of the interesting people you have met while traveling.
10417,General Response,The one most interesting person that I met while traveling was a girl from Estonia. This person made me rethink the way I look at life and the way I think about cultures around the world.

10422,Prompt,Talk about some of the interesting people you have met while traveling.
10423,General Response,I met regular people but one in particular had a dog and he was training it.  He and his wife were so very nice and their dog was well trained.  I talked with him a bit and they were so down to earth and not snooty at all.  Very very nice memory.
10424,Prompt,What do you hope to achieve in your professional life?
10425,General Response,"To learn a lot of new programming concepts and new ways to solve problems, and to make a lot of money!"
10426,Prompt,What do you hope to achieve in your professional life?
10427,General Response,I hope to earn enough money in my profession to never have to do it again. The whole goal of working is to not have to work.
10428,Prompt,What do you hope to achieve in your professional life?
10429,General Response,I want to be able to get more training so I am able to make more money because I want to provide better toys for my pets.
10430,Prompt,What do you hope to achieve in your professional life?
10431,General Response,"actually, at 61 years old, what I hope to achieve is to work a few more years and then retire.  after spending 38 years in the work force, I have about four more years to go.  it's not fun getting older, but I am looking forward to retiring and having  control of how I spend my days."
10432,Prompt,What do you hope to achieve in your professional life?
10433,General Response,I want to become a lawyer and a Charter Professional Accountant and be very successful in both fields.
10434,Prompt,Would you rather have the power to make anyone fall in love with you or be able to read minds?

10436,Prompt,Would you rather have the power to make anyone fall in love with you or be able to read minds?
10437,General Response,"I don't have the desire to rule over peoples emotions , but if I can read peoples  minds perhaps I will know what they feel"
10438,Prompt,Would you rather have the power to make anyone fall in love with you or be able to read minds?
10439,General Response,I would rather be able to read minds so that I can help people (and possibly animals if they are included) that cannot speak.
10440,Prompt,Would you rather have the power to make anyone fall in love with you or be able to read minds?
10441,General Response,I would rather be able to read in minds. The reason i say that is having the power to make someone to fall in love with you is not real. the love between you and that person would be fake and not loving.
10442,Prompt,Would you rather have the power to make anyone fall in love with you or be able to read minds?
10443,General Response,"Read minds. All of the people I love, love me back (except my cats), so I don't need that power. I'd be able to know what my baby needs when he's upset, know where to pet my cats, know what's bugging my husband when he ""doesn't want to talk about it"", what to get my dad for Father's Day/his birthday/Christmas, and I'd be able to annoy people by repeating back what they're thinking in a mocking tone when they make me angry. I'm really petty..."

10448,Prompt,Describe your least favorite current fad?
10449,General Response,My least favorite current fad is jeans with holes in them. Why are people paying for torn jeans? Why is that even the style? Those should be thrown out!
10450,Prompt,Describe your least favorite current fad?
10451,General Response,"I hate the droopy pants where you can see the boxers or underwear underneath while people are walking. I also hate the whorish clothes they make for girls with tight tops, shorts up to the butt crack."
10452,Prompt,Describe your least favorite current fad?
10453,General Response,"My least favorite fad is people posting n social media saying ""When you..."" along with a picture or gif, it is highly obnoxious."
10454,Prompt,Would you rather sneeze cheese or have your tears be chocolate flavored?
10455,General Response,"Sneezing cheese sounds very disgusting. Having chocolate flavored tears actually sounds kind of fun because if you were sad then you could have chocolate, which is what people want to do anyway when they're sad."
10456,Prompt,Would you rather sneeze cheese or have your tears be chocolate flavored?
10457,General Response,Definitely chocolate! Because then when I cry at least I could enjoy something sweet.
10458,Prompt,Would you rather sneeze cheese or have your tears be chocolate flavored?
10459,General Response,"I would rather have chocolate flavored tears, because every time I get sad and cry, I will get to experience the taste of chocolate, which will cheer me right up!"
10460,Prompt,Would you rather sneeze cheese or have your tears be chocolate flavored?

10464,Prompt,Would you rather be handsome/beautiful and marry an ugly person or be ugly and marry a handsome/beautiful person?

10590,Prompt,Would you rather have to use a public toilet that is extremely dirty and dark or one that has a snake in it?

10596,Prompt,What do you think of buffets?
10597,General Response,"I personally have no idea how buffets stay in business! I mean, every time I go into one of those restaurants there are people in there that act like they've never seen food before and have been told they'll never get the chance to eat again. They just mound their plates to the point of overflowing. I think buffets would probably make more money if they charged some sort of special valet service to roll guests who are too full back out to their cars."
10598,Prompt,What do you think of buffets?
10599,General Response,"I love to go to buffets because you are not limited to one dish on the menu. If you have a craving for different items, you can just select what you want for one single price. In the long run, I believe it is a better deal."

10616,Prompt,How can governments make education more efficient?

10620,Prompt,How can governments make education more efficient?
10621,General Response,"I think if the government gave more money to education than wellfare, it would improve a lot. The education budget just keeps getting cut when we should be building it up. Our kids deserve the brightest, and most successful future they can possibly have, but are getting held back by a government that refuses to give up their own paychecks for a greater America."
10622,Prompt,How can governments make education more efficient?
10623,General Response,"By putting more funding into education. It would also be helpful of they would quit regulating the way things are taught and allow students to learn different methods that work for them. Example: I had a math problem that I didn't understand when I was in, I think 6th grade. My dad explained a different way to do it and I got it right away. I got the problems I used that method on wrong because I didn't use the method the teacher taught. I had all of the answers right and I showed my work, but I didn't use the same method as everyone else."
10624,Prompt,Would you rather be a chef or a server?

""You eat what I make or you don't eat!"" As my mother used to say."
10628,Prompt,Would you rather be a chef or a server?

10636,Prompt,When did you realize people had accepted you as an adult?
10637,General Response,"When they started treating me as an equal. I don't have a specific time, it varied with different people. Even though I'm paying my own bills, married, have a child, and own a house, I have an aunt that still treats me like a child."
10638,Prompt,When did you realize people had accepted you as an adult?
10639,General Response,"I realized people had accepted me as an adult when I was in a class for college and I was auditing it, and some students came up to me and started asking me questions, like I was a special lecturer or something."
10640,Prompt,When did you realize people had accepted you as an adult?

10676,Prompt,What are some strange beliefs that some people have?
10677,General Response,"I believe most religions are strange. The belief in a God in the sky somewhere that helps in some ways, but also provides so much strife and struggle in others. These omnipresent beings that we are supposed to trust and implore to, but have so much wisdom and causes so much distress. People also like to carry on the myths of Santa and Tooth Fairy, which are largely based on materialism and I am not sure what their message or morals at the end of the day could really teach."
10678,Prompt,What are some strange beliefs that some people have?
10679,General Response,"Did you know that some people believe that the only reason we have the technology we have now is because many years ago, space aliens visited earth and left some of their own technology behind?

10714,Prompt,Do you text more or call more? Why?
10715,General Response,"I usually text more. I've never been much of a fan of phone conversations. Perhaps it's due to the deluge of date rejections I experienced from junior high through high school. Either way, it's always been easier to express myself with the written word."

10728,Prompt,Describe your dream car/motorcycle and why you love it.
10729,General Response,"My current dream car is very different from my dreams from childhood. I have just become to sensible and it may be no fun in my old mothering age. I want a car with good clearance, but not one that requires an additional hop and step to get into. I want a three row seating, but also great load capacity. I currently have seating, but my husband says the load capacity is not where it should be. Highly deceptive and confusing if you ask me! I want something durable, but not too big. A boring car, but with a fun paint job like a bright green! That would be nice and no carpet. Just rubber me insides that way it is fully functional. Lovely leather seats though please, because there is nothing better than worn out leather seats!"
10730,Prompt,Describe your dream car/motorcycle and why you love it.
10731,General Response,"My dream car would be a late model Mini Cooper with all the options (except moonroof because that would be stupid when sunroof is an option.) Mini Coopers are so cool. I have an older one (2003) and it's so fun to drive, however it's so noisy inside-- I would love to have a later model if for no other reason than to have a little tiny bit less road noise."
10732,Prompt,Describe your dream car/motorcycle and why you love it.

10744,Prompt,Do you like documentaries? Why / why not?
10745,General Response,Documentaries are great! I think what a lot of people don't get is that many filmmakers really put creative thinking into how they structure their documentaries. Often they are even more creative than narrative films since there is no need to stick to a main story line.
10746,Prompt,Do you like documentaries? Why / why not?

10754,Prompt,Would you rather be completely alone for 5 years or never alone for 5 years?
10755,General Response,"Is this a trick question? If I was never alone, how would I pee or shower or pick my nose? Those people who were with me 24/7 would have to become very tolerant and lower their standards on what a human being should be like. Wait. Completely alone? Does that mean no phone? That might be a deal breaker."

10764,Prompt,Would you rather not use your computer for a month or not eat junk food for a month?
10765,General Response,"Wow, talk about a no-win situation.  Either way and I'd lose.  but given the choice, I'd definitely give up junk food for a month for the simple reason that giving up for my computer for a month would be really, really hard for me.  I have become so reliant on the internet for so many things I do: taking part in fantasy sports leagues, checking sports stats, and of course doing these M-turk hits.  Not eating junk food for a month would be awful, but not nearly as awful as giving up my beloved computer for a month."
10766,Prompt,Would you rather not use your computer for a month or not eat junk food for a month?
10767,General Response,Definitely not eat junk food for a month. I couldn't live without my computer and I would be healthier without junk food.

10772,Prompt,Would you rather not use your computer for a month or not eat junk food for a month?
10773,General Response,"Wow, I would have to choose not to eat junk food. Is that sad? I love junk food, but if I cut junk food out of my diet, I would lose weight and save money. I don't think I would get the same benefit from not using my computer."
10774,Prompt,Would you rather walk barefoot in a public bathroom or through poison ivy?
10775,General Response,"I'd rather go through the poison ivy, since at least I know what it is. Who knows what is on the floor of a public bathroom? I'm gagging just thinking about it."
10776,Prompt,Would you rather walk barefoot in a public bathroom or through poison ivy?

10781,General Response,"I would rather walk through poison ivy. I have never gone through it, so the experience wouldn't be as bad, since it's the first time.

10802,Prompt,Would you rather be 42_ or 82_?

If it were a serious crime where I could be put to death - I would make sure to go to a country that does not have a extrication treaty with the US.

10856,Prompt,Would you rather have live one hundred years in the future or one hundred years in the past?
10857,General Response,"100 years in the past! No question, in some ways I am already trying to do so. We bought a piece of property last year and have started a farmstead. We are growing and raising our own food. We still use tech, but are trying to get back to a simpler way of life. It is the little things, that I love about it and make me want some more of the past. Nothing smells better then bread cooking in the oven, or laundry that has come fresh off the line. There is a sense of satisfaction that I don't get in my job that I do get from working our land. It's funny how some people react when I say we raise animals for food. People think it cruel, or gross, or too much work. Other think it is the most amazing thing ever!"

I probably might just do that instead.
10876,Prompt,Time freezes for everyone but you for one day. What do you do?
10877,General Response,When time freezes for everyone except me I sneak out onto football fields and create some modern art.
10878,Prompt,Time freezes for everyone but you for one day. What do you do?
10879,General Response,"If time froze and I could move, since that will never happen, I would do something I would never do. But, I would have to collect as much treasure as possible in that time frame, because I am poor, and it sucks."
10880,Prompt,Time freezes for everyone but you for one day. What do you do?
10881,General Response,I would travel the whole world and do things that I have never got to experience.

A person who has to make quick contact with someone can now achieve that.  in some ways it makes life more complicated because when technology breaks down, the results can be awful.  One example of this just happened to me in the last 2 weeks.  there was a computer break down at my local health clinic which resulted in a referral not being made to another health clinic.  I'm very upset about this; but that's another story.  But overall, it's simplified life in many ways."

10952,Prompt,How do you feel if you accidentally leave your phone at home?
10953,General Response,I don't like accidentally leaving my phone at home. I've become too used to keeping it on my person. I would feel sort of unsafe without it.

10992,Prompt,Would you rather have disappointing sex every night for a full year or great sex for one night?
10993,General Response,"If the sex is actually disappointing and not just mediocre, I'd rather have great sex one night than 365 days of sex that isn't fun or interesting."

11131,General Response,"I don't like to read in public places because I find it distracting.  I would be watching the different people pass by, rather than reading the book.  I like to read at home where it is quiet and there are no distractions."
11132,Prompt,"Do you like to read in public places, like a coffee shop?"
11133,General Response,Not really. I can never really concentrate in public places. It always seems to be too loud and distracting.
11134,Prompt,Would you rather be able to fly everywhere you want or be invisible?
11135,General Response,"I would rather be able to fly everywhere, because if I wanted to be invisible I would fly up far away, then it's practically like I'm invisible. But, really I think about being a bird and flying over the ocean everyday."
11136,Prompt,Would you rather be able to fly everywhere you want or be invisible?
11137,General Response,"I would like to invisible, imagine all the things I could see and how much money I would save by not paying for entry!"

11147,General Response,"I would rather own an island because it would be more fun to build on it, and I can always charter a boat to get there."
11148,Prompt,Would you rather own your own boat or your own island?
11149,General Response,This is a catch 22 because if I owned my own island I would want a boat so I could go back and forth on it.  IF I put all that aside I would chose the island because I can always hire someone to take me to my island because if I have the money to buy that I hope I would have the money to purchase a boat.
11150,Prompt,Would you rather own your own boat or your own island?
11151,General Response,I would rather own my own island because land is better than material and an island is definitely worth more than a boat.

11162,Prompt,Where did you go last weekend? What did you do?
11163,General Response,Last weekend I traveled to my hometown to visit my parents.  I haven't seen them in over 7 months so we just got caught up on everything.  My parents had presents set aside for me from all the Holidays I had missed so it was a nice weekend spent with them.
11164,Prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
11165,General Response,"OMG! Are we talking a poisonous snake or a harmless one?  I'm not particularly scared of snakes in general so if it's nonpoisonous, then definitely I'd rather hold the snake. But if it's a poisonous snake, then I'll take the bee sting on the face. Better that than risk a snake bite from a poisonous snake."
11166,Prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
11167,General Response,I'd rather hold a snake because that's not painful and I am not scared of them.

11172,Prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
11173,General Response,"I would rather hold a snake, as long as it isn't poisonous.  If it is poisonous, then I would rather a bee sting me on the face.  If I could choose, I'd prefer to have the bee sting on my cheeks, away from my eyes and mouth."
11174,Prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
11175,General Response,"I'm not sure what defines a sport. I believe fishing is a sport because it's competitive but I'm not sure a sport needs to be competitive to be considered a sport. Fishing is more physical than most people would expect. Video game tournaments are definitely sporting events, people are competing with their skill, knowledge, strategy, and hand-eye coordination-- it may not be an easy concept for people who grew up on Pac-Man to accept but video games have all the elements of a sport."
11176,Prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?

11182,Prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
11183,General Response,"To me, physical exertion defines the word ""sport"". I would consider fishing to be a sport, however, I would consider video game tournaments to be a hobby."
11184,Prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
11185,General Response,A submarine! I'd explore the ocean and be home in time for dinner. Can't do that with a space ship.
11186,Prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
11187,General Response,"I'd rather have a submarine because most of the sea remains unexplored, and a space shuttle is not designed for deep space exploration."
11188,Prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
11189,General Response,I would rather have a submarine. I love the water. Im not a fan of heights. I think i would like the view alot better below then on top
11190,Prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?

11192,Prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
11193,General Response,"I would rather have a submarine because I still want to stay on Earth.  Although the idea of being so deep under water is frightening, being in outer space is even more scary to me."

11199,General Response,I like that the seasons change so I would prefer to live those places
11200,Prompt,Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?
11201,General Response,"Okay, everybody knows that I hate cold weather with a passion. And I live in NC, so we get four seasons, even though I know our winters aren't as cold as other parts of the US...but if I could, I'd live in southwest Florida...I don't need four seasons!"
11202,Prompt,Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?

11206,Prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
11207,General Response,"If I could bring back any TV show that was cancelled, it would have to be 2 Broke Girls. That show was so bad that I'd bring it back just to see it canceled again."
11208,Prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
11209,General Response,"This is going to sound crazy that I'm still upset over them canceling Dracula with Jonathan Rhys Meyers but, come on! It made no sense. They only gave it two seasons and when they announced they were canceling it, the fans went ballistic. So, yeah... if I could bring back one show that was canceled, I'd definitely bring back Dracula with the original cast."
11210,Prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
11211,General Response,I would ask to bring back sleepy hollow. I loved that show and how they brought in icabod crane. I thought it was really interesting.
11212,Prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
11213,General Response,I would bring back Futurama--I enjoyed watching that show a lot and would like to see more misadventures with the characters.
11214,Prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
11215,General Response,The worst fast food place happens to be Hardee's. Hardee's has the soggiest french fries coupled with extremely greasy burgers and sandwiches. I've tried to give them second chances but they always seem to fail. Even their milkshakes fall short of being tasty. The food and drinks taste bland and boring time after time.
11216,Prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
11217,General Response,All of them? How do you pick one out of many that will damage your health? But as far as taste goes I think it would be Arby's. If you are going to  eat unhealthy food make it count.
11218,Prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
11219,General Response,"Jack in the Box is terrible, it's by far the worst fast food restaurant chain. I think though the worst fast food restaurant is a little Teriyaki place in Woodland, WA. The people are wonderful and I feel bad saying they're the worst, but nothing I've ordered there even resembles what it's supposed to be, it's pretty awful. Did I mention the people are wonderful? They are-- just order a soda or iced tea, because they really are very nice. Or pick up food there for your enemies.I'm a bad person."
11220,Prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
11221,General Response,"Krystal's is the absolute worst fast food restaurant. The famous Krystal burgers are not filling, they're bland, and they have a weird texture to the meat."
11222,Prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
11223,General Response,I honestly can't stand eating at hardees. All there food taste like old grease.
11224,Prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
11225,General Response,"Can't say that I do either, but I guess scratching my privates.  Itches happen...there is nothing other than pure nastiness that leads to someone, especially an adult, eating boogers!"
11226,Prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
11227,General Response,"Scratching my privates I suppose, worst comment that could happen there is something along the lines of ""Typical man"""
11228,Prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
11229,General Response,"I would rather get caught eating a booger. It's better to be judged as someone who ""just needed a little salt,"" versus, being judged as someone who might have a case of raging crabs in their private parts and spreading it to others if they don't wash their hands."
11230,Prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
11231,General Response,well theyre both disgusting but eating a booger is far worse than getting caught scratching your private
11232,Prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
11233,General Response,"Ewwww, for real!? I would rather get caught scratching my privates. Eating a booger would just be gross. I almost want to gag thinking about it!"
11234,Prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
11235,General Response,I think they are useful and are needed.  There has to be someway to measure student's knowledge and teaching success.  But I do believe that this should never be the only measure used.  These test results need to be used in conjunction with other measures.
11236,Prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
11237,General Response,"Standardize test are not beneficial to student. Lesson and locations of student differ greatly across countries, especially large countries. Since students are taught differently, they are not equally tested on their intellectual ability."
11238,Prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
11239,General Response,"I don't think that they're really useful at all. They are not only too easy, but also a waste of time because that's all you get taught."
11240,Prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
11241,General Response,Standardized tests are unfair to the students since the individuals do not get a chance to showcase their best talents
11242,Prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
11243,General Response,"I think standarized tests are terrible as a teacher and they do not measure what students know. The teachers are only allowed to teach to the test to get high scores for the district so they can receive money and be compared to other districts. These tests do not take into account upbringing, home life, students personal struggles, mental health issues, the lack of funding in their school districts, parental life."

We are always on the course of lowering our debt. So there is always that.
11250,Prompt,What are your goals for the next two years?
11251,General Response,"My goal is to attain a new job, grow our landscaping business and customer base and be able to purchase a new car and better home."
11252,Prompt,What are your goals for the next two years?

11257,General Response,"I love going to concerts!  It's even better now that there's almost always a meet and greet after the show and you can meet the band!  The last show I saw was either Gaelic Storm or Breaking Benjamin.  I saw both of them in the last year, both were AMAZING!  I got to meet both bands, get autographs, and I can't wait to see them again!"

I can't recall the name of the concert, it was in my tween years, but it was like a christian version of Lollapalooza, ya know?"
11262,Prompt,Do you like going to concerts? Why or why not? What was the last concert you went to?

11272,Prompt,What is the most overrated movie?
11273,General Response,"In my opinion, Forrest Gump is the most overrated. I think the Forrest Gump joke is funny though; where he's standing at the Pearly Gates in Heaven!"

11280,Prompt,What is your favorite novel?
11281,General Response,"My most favorite novel would be Little Women. It was a story that I immersed myself at an early age and impressed me with the feminine spunk. The girl did not always have to pair off with the boy. Life was unexpected, but full of charm and joy."
11282,Prompt,What is your favorite novel?
11283,General Response,"My favorite novel is Exodus by Leon Uris.  Uris immerses the reader in the lives, places, culture, and history of his novels to the point that the reader feels they have lived the story."
11284,Prompt,Would you rather save your country from an invasion or from a terrible disease?
11285,General Response,I would rather save it from a terrible disease. Germs can spread fast and are hard to control...but we have a great military to fight an invasion.
11286,Prompt,Would you rather save your country from an invasion or from a terrible disease?
11287,General Response,"I would rather save my country from a terrible disease, because when someone is stricken by a disease there is no face. If it is your loved one that is stricken and you need to quarantine and understand what is going on. The human nature in all of us and knowledge and there is so much in diseases, so much in nature that we may never know that terrifies us. The threat from another country is much easier to combat. I believe the hysteria and the unknown is something that we can manage."
11288,Prompt,Would you rather save your country from an invasion or from a terrible disease?

11304,Prompt,Would you rather stand all day at work or sit all day at work?

11785,General Response,My own personal hell looks a lot like living with my parents for the rest of my life rather than getting out on my own where I can make my own decisions without being questioned and made to feel stupid about everything I say and do.

Acquaintances are all fine and dandy, but there have been more moments than not, when I needed my best friend by my side."

11855,General Response,Designer clothes can be fun and glamorous but I don't know where I'd wear them. But discount store items can be pretty boring and all look alike. I kind of like  a little shock value. I want to wear something amazing  I'd be murdered in it.
11856,Prompt,Would you rather be able to dress in designer clothes or buy everything you want at a discount store?

11876,Prompt,What is your most interesting hobby?
11877,General Response,That would have to be fishing. I never know if I'm going to go and catch something or stand there for four hours without a bite. It's always interesting to me how fish decide if they wanna bite the hook or not.

I can break a window and get into my apartment, but I can't replace all the photos and memories that I have in my phone. Plus, I could totally Tweet and Snapchat myself trying to break back into my house after losing my keys. I bet it would get a lot of hits."
11886,Prompt,Would you rather lose your keys (all of them: house and car) or lose your phone?
11887,General Response,"I would much rather lose my keys as opposed to my phone!

My keys can be replaced easily but it would take a very long time to replace the information in my phone."
11888,Prompt,Would you rather lose your keys (all of them: house and car) or lose your phone?
11889,General Response,"I would rather lose my phone. Of course, I'm old so I could just use my keys that I didn't lose to drive home and unlock my front door to get inside the house to use my house phone. Yes, I still have a landline."

I already have monthly subscriptions to watching things on screen.

11901,General Response,"I go to the movie theater at least two or three times a month. I'm addicted to movies. And, hey, even if we don't see a movie while we're there, the theater near my house has got a great cafe and place to meet my friends."
11902,Prompt,When was the last time you went to a movie theater?
11903,General Response,"It's actually been a little while. It was my girlfriend's birthday, which coincided with Earth Day this year. Every year, they release a movie made for Earth Day, and she is a huge fan of them. They're essentially long Planet Earth episodes that focus in on a family of monkeys, bears, or some other cute critter. This year, the film was called Born in China and was a decent film that combined cuteness with emotion. She enjoyed it and I was glad she did!"

11908,Prompt,What was the last song you listened to?

11916,Prompt,What was your turning point to a more active life?

11919,General Response,When I got married and would rather go for a run than be home.
11920,Prompt,What was your turning point to a more active life?
11921,General Response,"During college I never had time to go outside and be active. I was always stuck in sitting down in front of my laptop, working. I started to get really restless legs which made it so difficult for me to fall asleep at night. I also would always have a really sore neck and back from hunching over my laptop all day. It started to get really hard for me to sit at my laptop for long periods, and I realized I needed to do something. I decided to take up running just a couple times a week and it helped me so much with my restless legs and my posture."
11922,Prompt,What was your turning point to a more active life?
11923,General Response,"I was getting ready to join the military and I realized I had never been physically active in my life. If I could get out of gym class in school, I did. So I printed out the minimum requirements to pass the physical exam in the military and worked towards it every day."

11932,Prompt,How fast do you read?
11933,General Response,"I try to absorb two books per week. Obviously it depends on the size of the book, considering I can breeze through Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle in a couple days yet spend most of that particular week delving through Stephen King's It. I'll never try to read more than two at a time though, but not for the most obvious reasons; I use a King of Hearts as a bookmark - and I only possess two of them. Maybe some day I'll buy myself another pack of cards to read a third book, but I'm content for now."
11934,Prompt,Would you rather have all of your emails for the next two months made public or have your text messages read by everyone?

11988,Prompt,What book has influenced you the most?
11989,General Response,"I would have to say Harry Potter.

I have specific ""safe places"" that I can go to with ease, like a close friend's or my parents' house, but anything outside that comfort zone is absolutely terrifying for me."
12040,Prompt,What makes you nervous?
12041,General Response,The prospect of not being able to pay my bills makes me nervous because I enjoy the comfort of my lifestyle.
12042,Prompt,What makes you nervous?
12043,General Response,It's funny because dangerous or life threatening situations don't make me very nervous. Take something as harmless as a cockroach or public speaking and I become a nervous wreck.

12080,Prompt,What is a movie moment that completely transformed you?
12081,General Response,"In saving private ryan in the beginning when they were on the shore during fire, the passion of life is so well expressed it was sad.

Life is precious and at one time or another we all tke things for granted at how our freedom came to be."
12082,Prompt,What is a movie moment that completely transformed you?
12083,General Response,Rocky! Definitely Rocky. When he reaches the top of the stairs at the end of the montage. Made me feel like I could do anything. That movie has always been such a huge motivation for me.

12164,Prompt,How have TV shows changed over the years?
12165,General Response,"TV shows have much more adult content than they used to.  Once the government assumed children would be watching so there could be no explicit sexual scenes or dialogue.  Even hints and innuendos were not always approved of.  Gay people were never shown.  Now almost everything is up for grabs, all kinds of sexual scenes are shown even in the early evening hours and there is a lot of explicit dialogue.  It is commonplace now to have gay relationships shown on screen."
12166,Prompt,How have TV shows changed over the years?
12167,General Response,"One way the television shows have changed over the years is the way that they depict sex.

Nowadays you can see all sorts of scenes between unmarried people in the bedroom."
12168,Prompt,How have TV shows changed over the years?

Grasshoppers are large, so they are easy to catch and get rid of, they are not poisonous, in fact if you are hungry enough you can even eat them, and although they will eat some plants and maybe some things in your kitchen like flour, they will not make a mess the way spiders will leaving webs."

12830,Prompt,What is the fanciest restaurant you have eaten at?
12831,General Response,"I have worked in a few ""fancy""restaurants and being behind the scenes, or the ""curtain"" so to speak really puts things in perspective. I guess the most costly and ""fancy"" of eating out experiences I have had was on an anniversary with my husband where we went to a French restaurant and splurged. I still remember some moments from that meal, but for some reason I do not remember the most costly component which was the main course. I only recall the appetizer and the dessert and some of the drinks my husband chose to spend our money on! He was a big spender when it came to drinks!"

I was really impressed and still brag about how well they took care of me."

12838,Prompt,Would you rather be on a game show or star in a soap opera?
12839,General Response,"I would actually be a star in a soap opera just because i feel like those characters are designed to be attractive to the viewers while game shows devalue the people they display, what do you think?"
12840,Prompt,Would you rather be on a game show or star in a soap opera?
12841,General Response,I'd rather star on a soap opera. I think that being in front of a live audience would be stressful. Acting around a group of people seems fairly easier.

12843,General Response,"Oh my goodness, Well that's really hard! I have always been interested in game shows like totally wanting to go on one. However, Soap opera seems kind of interesting if I were able to act."

12891,General Response,I'd rather save the life of a child.  an elderly family member has limited time left.

12893,General Response,"Even though it would be a difficult choice, I would probably save the life of a family member over someone else.  This is a hard choice because a child is presumably innocent and would deserve to live.  Hopefully I could save both lives and wouldn't have to choose."

12907,General Response,"It would have to be a cockroach. Cockroaches are probably the scariest thing on this planet at their current size, so if they could be the size of an elephant, I don't think I could handle that.

12922,Prompt,Where do you spend most of your free time / day?
12923,General Response,"Being a stay at home mom to a new baby, I rarely have free time. There's house work, doctor's appointments, child development classes, keeping the baby entertained, helping the baby reach all of his milestones,  trying to do some surveys and Mturk work to earn a little extra petty cash while fighting to keep the baby who suddenly woke up from a dead sleep from eating the device I'm using, comfort feeding a growing, teething baby in the middle of a leap, fighting the urge to rearrange everything and paint the house because you're going stir crazy,  and fending off visitors who just want to criticize everything you're doing. When my husband comes home and takes over baby play time,  I finally get a break from all of that, I like to just sit and relax with my cats."

Just having a simple conversation with my mother I enjoy, listening to her explain how her day went, or me explaining to her how my day went. I don't need to go anywhere extravagant to feel relaxed. I would rather be around people I actually care about."
12932,Prompt,Where do you go and what do you do to wind down/relax?

I'd just think about something pleasant and get it over with.
12952,Prompt,Would you rather eat a dead bug or a live worm?
12953,General Response,"Ewe that's a tough one I'm not guessing neither is an option here?? 

I mean it's not right??

And the few times I've seen in in movies or interviews, especially while David Letterman was still on, I just always thought, now that's a guy I'd like to sit down and talk to for a while. He seems to funny and interesting."
13014,Prompt,"Would you rather sleep upside down like a bat, or eat all of your food from a feedbag like a horse?"

13016,Prompt,"Would you rather sleep upside down like a bat, or eat all of your food from a feedbag like a horse?"

13021,General Response,"I would rather sleep upside down like a bat, not because I think it would be cool or awesome, but because the alternative posed, eating from a feed bag....is something I know I would NOT want to do. You can't hold a conversation with a feed bag over your face, and meals are a social thing for me and my family."
13022,Prompt,"Would you rather sleep upside down like a bat, or eat all of your food from a feedbag like a horse?"
13023,General Response,"Like abat,because it would reverse the effects of gravity from standing all day."

13028,Prompt,What was the best time period of your life? What do you think will be the best time period of your entire life?
13029,General Response,I would have to say the best time period of my life was my teenage years. Not having major responsibilities and just living life and having fun.

Being a new mom, I'm rediscovering who I am and enjoying every moment of baby snuggles. I have this picture of the future in my head of the best period of my life. In it, I have more than just the one child, I've raised them successfully and I'm sitting next to my husband, holding his hand, on the back porch of a house we built together, watching our children play with our grandkids. My husband will be the same man that I am married to now."
13032,Prompt,What was the best time period of your life? What do you think will be the best time period of your entire life?

I am more confident in my body and in my self than I have ever been. I am more assertive, I take less shit, and I care more deeply about those around me. I am really looking forward to the next few decades. I am really hoping that my retirement years are the best of my life. I want to enjoy life."

13038,Prompt,Can you think of any technology that has only made the world worse? How about a piece of technology that has only made the world better?
13039,General Response,"An example of technology that has only made the world worse is nuclear weaponry. It is a threat that provokes fear in people from around the world. The effects of a nuclear attack would be devastating and nothing good could possibly come of it. On the other hand, an example of technology that has only made the world better would have to be central heating and cooling, which have made it so one can be comfortable in their home regardless of the temperature outdoors."
13040,Prompt,Can you think of any technology that has only made the world worse? How about a piece of technology that has only made the world better?

13042,Prompt,Can you think of any technology that has only made the world worse? How about a piece of technology that has only made the world better?
13043,General Response,"Computers and the Internet have made the world better, as they can quickly process information, and store a lot of old information that may be needed. The Internet, you can say, could have made the world worse. Social Media exposed a lot of horrible people with horrible opinions that should have not seen the light of day."
13044,Prompt,Is it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?
13045,General Response,"It is always better to have loved and lost at least you know what love is like, it is nice to be loved and to love. If you have never lost you don't know what it is like and the purpose of life is experiences and relationships."
13046,Prompt,Is it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?

13053,General Response,"No, I think it is better to never have loved at all.  I think that if you never loved, you don't know what you are missing.  However, if you love and lose it, you feel the pain of that loss forever."
13054,Prompt,Would you rather have to shout everything you say or whisper everything you say?
13055,General Response,I'd rather whisper everything. People who shout randomly in public always seem crazy. You'd also probably get kicked out of a lot of places if you just kept shouting. At least with whispering I could still go see a movie or go to a restaurant without being dragged out of there kicking and shouting.
13056,Prompt,Would you rather have to shout everything you say or whisper everything you say?
13057,General Response,I really dislike loud noises so if I had to pick between needing to whispered rest of my life or needing to shout I would pick whisperer. If you needed to always shout you could never have romantic relationships or work with small children.
13058,Prompt,Would you rather have to shout everything you say or whisper everything you say?
13059,General Response,"I would rather have to whisper everything--I don't enjoy being loud, and I think my voice would get hoarse very quickly."
13060,Prompt,Would you rather have to shout everything you say or whisper everything you say?
13061,General Response,Id rather be able to whisper but people dont listen and you will end up having to shout.
13062,Prompt,Would you rather have to shout everything you say or whisper everything you say?
13063,General Response,"I would rather whisper, my dad is hard of hearing so he shouts everything he says and sometimes it gives me a headache. Whispering would just be more polite as long as everyone could hear me."

13072,Prompt,What incredibly common thing in life terrifies you?
13073,General Response,"Storms. I didn't mind them until last year. We bought our own home, which doesn't have a basement. Coincidentally, the tornado sirens have gone of significantly more times since we've moved. Our house also feels like it's going to be blown apart by heavy winds."
13074,Prompt,What song do you secretly like but would not admit it elsewhere?
13075,General Response,"I secretly like Madonna songs, but I don't admit it normally. It seems like whenever I do, people begin to assume my sexual orientation, and I think it's important that nobody labels me or others by our likes and dislikes."
13076,Prompt,What song do you secretly like but would not admit it elsewhere?
13077,General Response,"Fish Heads from Barnes and Barnes. It's just so corny, but it brings a smile to my face when I listen to it."

13087,General Response,"A place that is cold is much better, and all that is needed to survive is more layers of clothing, while a hot place can be unbearable and if water or electricity runs out then it is really bad."
13088,Prompt,Would you rather live in a place where it is always cold or in a place that is always hot?

13090,Prompt,Would you rather live in a place where it is always cold or in a place that is always hot?

13092,Prompt,Would you rather live in a place where it is always cold or in a place that is always hot?
13093,General Response,"I would rather live in a place where it is always cold. You can bundle up and add layers, but it is hard to cool off when it gets too hot. We do not have central AC in our house (most houses in WA are lacking central AC) and it was miserable hot and only 97 degrees outside. I don't like the heat!"

13118,Prompt,"If given the chance, would you become an astronaut even if it meant spending years at a time in space?"

13134,Prompt,"Would you rather borrow $10,000 from your parents or borrow $1000 from your friends?"
13135,General Response,"I would prefer to borrow $1,000 from my friends.  Borrowing $10,000 from my parents is way too much money, and it would place a burden on them and our relationship."
13136,Prompt,"Would you rather borrow $10,000 from your parents or borrow $1000 from your friends?"
13137,General Response,"I'd rather borrow $10,000 from my parents. My parents would understand and would not think less of me for getting into a situation where I needed to borrow from them.

13141,General Response,"I would borrow the $1000 from friends, because if I am to borrow money it would be a much lower amount and I can replace it readily. The $10,000 is incredibly grand amount to be borrowing from my family. I could not live with the guilt of doing that. I am the eldest and female in my family and I had a very sheltered childhood. It was heavily influenced by my culture and it would be very difficult to ask for help being the eldest. There are very high expectations of me."
13142,Prompt,"Would you rather borrow $10,000 from your parents or borrow $1000 from your friends?"
13143,General Response,"I would rather borrow $1K from my friends than $10K from my parents.  First and foremost, IF I have to borrow money, I'd prefer to borrow the least amount possible.  I don't worry about borrowing from parents versus friends, because I plan to pay it back either way."

13149,General Response,"A book called ""Love 'em or Lose 'em"". It is a management book. My boss back in 2007 gave it to me before he would promote me to a supervisor position. That was my first real management position which really launched my existing career. The book taught me how to approach people that I would manage, how to be transparent and to understand different people have different currency or values at work, and how to appeal to those."
13150,Prompt,What book has had the biggest impact on your life?
13151,General Response,The book that had the biggest impact on my life would be one of the mid 2000's Guinness Book of World Records. I could read that everyday as a kid and not get bored about learning useless records.

13162,Prompt,What is something new you learned this week?
13163,General Response,"I learn something new nearly every day. At least I try to. Sometimes I miss the lesson, but it comes around to my old addled brain sooner or later. I think I learned this week that my body is aging and I need to put it on an exercise regime. I did not always treat it fairly in my young age and now I may feel the repercussions."
13164,Prompt,What do you think of homeschooling?
13165,General Response,"I have mixed feelings about it.  I like the thought of my children not being bullied in school, and not being victims of random violence.  However, the lack of socialization with other kids would be very harmful.  Even if my kids socialized with kids in the neighborhood, it wouldn't be as valuable as making friends with kids in school.  So all in all, homeschooling has it's advantages, but I'd probably stay away from it."
13166,Prompt,What do you think of homeschooling?
13167,General Response,"I think it works for some people, but not most.  I don't think it would work for our family very much because my kids honestly listen better to other people than they do their mother when we are trying to be serious and focused about something, especially for any amount of time.  If I home schooled instead of working full time, I would also drink a lot more."
13168,Prompt,What do you think of homeschooling?
13169,General Response,I think to each there own. Kids need to socialize yet a lot of schools have become absorbed with sports and socializing. Homeschooling gives the child more attention and one on one this could be good if there struggling in normal school settings.
13170,Prompt,What do you think of homeschooling?
13171,General Response,I think homeschooling can be very beneficial and can help children excel at there own pace. If your goal is to get a high school diploma quickly it is also the way to go. You can excel more quickly then you could in a traditional public school. You can also control the environment that children are learning in. Where as it varies so much in public schools.
13172,Prompt,What do you think of homeschooling?
13173,General Response,I think it is good to home school but only if you have the time to devote to it and the dedication to do it well.
13174,Prompt,What was the first thing you bought with your first paycheck?
13175,General Response,"I honestly cannot remember what the first thing I bought with my first paycheck. I would have been fifteen at the time, so if I had to guess based on what I liked at that time it was probably either a Harvest Moon or Spyro video game."

13186,Prompt,Would you rather be bitten by a poison snake or a poison spider?
13187,General Response,"I would rather be bitten by a snake...I have the biggest fear of spiders. It's almost a phobia. Spiders are the only thing that frighten me to the point of tears. So yeah, I'll take the snake bite. A spider bite wold probably put me in the psych ward for a while!"
13188,Prompt,Would you rather be bitten by a poison snake or a poison spider?
13189,General Response,"I would much rather be bitten by a poison spider than a poison snake. Spider bites are almost never fatal, and far less dangerous and snake bites. Plus I might have the satisfaction of swatting or stepping on the spider than bit me."
13190,Prompt,Would you rather be bitten by a poison snake or a poison spider?
13191,General Response,I myself hate both snakes and spiders so this is a very difficult decision for me.  Snakes have big fangs with a lot of venom so I think I would rather be bitten by the spider because it wont be as painful.
13192,Prompt,Would you rather be bitten by a poison snake or a poison spider?
13193,General Response,"Can I say ""neither""? Because neither of those options sound pleasant at all. A snake bite is so much bigger! Ok... I would choose spider. My dad was bitten by a hobo spider once, and he said it was painful, however I can't imagine it being more so than a snake bike? Unless its the worlds tiniest snake and the worlds largest spider? Yea, I choose spider. Do I get to pick the spider?"

13203,General Response,I am obsessed with my tablet computer because it is such a good communications device.
13204,Prompt,Would you rather have your grandmothers hairstyle or first name?
13205,General Response,"I would rather have her hairstyle. A 6'3"" male named Linda would probably turn some heads."
13206,Prompt,Would you rather have your grandmothers hairstyle or first name?

13216,Prompt,Would you rather date someone who is 10 years older or someone 10 years younger?
13217,General Response,"So I'm 40, and I would be fine with either, if I were single. When I was 30 I dated a 21 year old, and as fun as it was...we just weren't on the same page maturity wise. And who wants to be called a cougar at age 30?"
13218,Prompt,Would you rather date someone who is 10 years older or someone 10 years younger?
13219,General Response,"I think I'd rather date someone 10 years younger.  I'm 61 years old and to be honest, the thought of dating someone over 70 years old is not inviting.

13231,General Response,"Yes, absolutely. I don't necessarily think it comes naturally, I just think that some people were born with younger siblings they had to help raise. These same skills can be taught to adults."
13232,Prompt,Is teaching a skill that can be taught?
13233,General Response,"As a teacher i feel teaching can and can't be taught, you can certainly teach someone to teach, give the, all the material they need, explain what it will be like and what to expect.

13238,Prompt,Are bigger or small schools better?
13239,General Response,"This is a tough one...but I think for the most part, bigger ones are better for learning social skills, but smaller ones my be better for kids that have disabilities. When it comes to college...not too big...sitting in a lecture hall with 200 other students kind of makes you feel like you are just a needle in a haystack."

13265,General Response,"Superman. I mean, Batman would not go down easily but Superman is a freaking alien with impregnable flesh. Sure Batman could easily buy some kryptonite with his giant fortune, but Superman always finds a way to survive. Plus, he can use his x-ray vision to see that Batman is actually Bruce Wayne and then catch him on fire with his laser eyes while he was sleeping. I've never seen Batman vs Superman, but they probably should have hired me to write that script."
13266,Prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Batman or Superman?"
13267,General Response,"Oh, come on. At the end of the day, Batman is just a man who's real;y good at martial arts and has a lot of fancy toys. Superman is an alien! Let's be real, Superman would always win, hands down."

13274,Prompt,What do you think about the organic food movement?
13275,General Response,"It took a while for us to be a part of the organic food movement, but we are finally there. It is an inevitable step in this information age.

Its great that people are asking questions and there are options and they are becoming more and more reasonable and accessible every day."
13276,Prompt,What do you think about the organic food movement?

13278,Prompt,What do you think about the organic food movement?
13279,General Response,"I think the organic food movement is interesting. I am in the middle. I usually don't buy organic because it is more expensive but I also feel like non organic can be just as good, depending on how and where it was grown."
13280,Prompt,What do you think about the organic food movement?
13281,General Response,If people want to waste money on food that costs more because it is organic then more power to them.  I could not care less if they food that I eat is organic or not and will never pay extra for food that is.
13282,Prompt,What do you think about the organic food movement?
13283,General Response,I am torn on this one. I think the certified organic movement is a crock. It is expense and cost prohibitive for most small farmers. There are an awful lot of hoops to jump through to attaint that label. Another issue I have is that people associate organic with no pesticide use and that is not the case. Big organic farms still use pesticides and practices that are not necessarily best for the environment. Pesticides that kill thousands of pollinators such as honey bees annually. I do think that people are paying more attention to what they are eating and starting to bring their business to their local farmer.

13312,Prompt,What would you do if you had no money?
13313,General Response,"I would try to live off the land. I would make shelter in the woods, I would probably have to eat leaves and berries and stuff, I don't think I would be able to kill an animal to eat, but I guess if I was really that desperate I might get over it and do it."
13314,Prompt,Who had the biggest impact on the person you have become?
13315,General Response,"It would have to be Louisa May Alcott. Her book Little Women shaped a lot of how I saw myself and people in the community. There were admirable characters that were kind, had depth, strove for a better community, and pushed past societal boundaries."
13316,Prompt,Who had the biggest impact on the person you have become?
13317,General Response,"My father had the biggest impact on me as I grew up.  He was a Master plumber and had his own business.  He always talked to me about what I wanted to be, then he always told me to be sure and finish school, so that I could have a good job."
13318,Prompt,Who had the biggest impact on the person you have become?
13319,General Response,"The biggest impact would be my first child. I jokingly tell people that much of my memory is gone since childbirth, but it is actually a reality. There is so much pressure and constant moving forward when it comes to tending to children. You need to be a step ahead otherwise you lose your foothold on being the primary caregiver in their life. I feel very responsible to be ready for anything they want to pursue, so it has been incredibly challenging and with every hurdle I am a much better, more accomplished person for it."
13320,Prompt,Who had the biggest impact on the person you have become?
13321,General Response,"I hate to say it, but my ex-husband. Dealing with him has given me world class peace keeping skills and taught me the value of advocating for myself."

13328,Prompt,What is your worst experience in a foreign country?
13329,General Response,"I went to India for a whole summer with my family once since my dad had to move there temporarily for work. Although looking back on it, there were parts I really enjoyed, it was definitely a huge culture shock. We didn't even go to a big city, we went to a small town in the middle of nowhere. Everybody stared at us everywhere we went, since we were the only foreigners around, which was very uncomfortable. On top of that, it was just very heartbreaking to see the way people lived there. As foreigners, people assumed we had loads of money and made us feel very unwelcome. I was only maybe 11 when I went, and some beggar actually spit on my face for not giving him money, even though I was a kid and didn't have anything on me."
13330,Prompt,What is your worst experience in a foreign country?
13331,General Response,"I went to Japan, and my GPS app was not working in the subway there, so I ended up boarding the wrong train and got lost for 25 hours."
13332,Prompt,What is your worst experience in a foreign country?
13333,General Response,My worst experience in a foreign country is building a church in Mexico with ungrateful friends for an ungrateful organization.

13352,Prompt,"If you could own a private yacht or private plane, which do you choose and why?"
13353,General Response,"no question about it; I'd go with the yacht.  I've heard of too many people who lost their lives in planes; some of them private planes.  a hero of mine, the late yankee catcher Thurman Munson, died while he was trying to learn to fly a plane.  no thank you; i'll go with the yacht."
13354,Prompt,"If you could visit any fictional town/place, what would it be?"

It takes all that stress away."
13388,Prompt,Do you think money can buy happiness?

13393,General Response,money can absolutely not buy happiness. we see people with money everyday who have many issues

13402,Prompt,Would you rather travel 100 years into the future or 100 years into the past?
13403,General Response,"Man, that's a tough one. I think I would rather travel 100 years into the future.

Unless something really unusual happens, that person will be able to use that talent and ability for many years.  I would think that being a stand-up comedian would be much tougher.  A comedian has to continue modifying his talents, remaining up to date...I think the pressure would be very difficult.  And to make a living doing that? Very unlikely.

13738,Prompt,What weird or useless talent do you have?
13739,General Response,"My weird talent is that my fingers are double jointed. Although, that's actually an inaccurate term. It's actually called hypermobility.

It didn't take them long to catch on to my trick, though."

13743,General Response,"I have a weird ability to sing like a person from an opera for a really long time. But, it's really bad, and I don't know Italian, so it's nonsense, and silly sounding."

13763,General Response,The socks over the bottom of the pants and legwarmers. It was just ridiculous

13826,Prompt,"Do you like seeing movies on the weekend with lots of people, or during the week when nobody is there?"
13827,General Response,"I also went to movies during the cheaper matinee weekday times. When there is more people there is an increased likelihood of someone spoiling your evening.

13844,Prompt,What do you get every time you go grocery shopping?
13845,General Response,"I have to buy milk every time I go grocery shopping. I have a 1.5 year old who drinks milk as if it's water. My other 2 kids also drink milk, but not as much as this guy.

13921,General Response,"I would rather lie to a best friend becuase friends come and go, while parents are forever and they provide for you."
13922,Prompt,Would you rather lie to your parents or lie to your best friend?
13923,General Response,"It's so hard to lie to my parents but my best friend knows me better than they do. There's no I could lie to my best friend and get away with it. I guess I'd have to say I'd lie to my folks. Sorry, mom!"
13924,Prompt,Would you rather marry someone who does not love you or marry someone you do not love?
13925,General Response,"Oh my, what a question.  A terrible choice; a real ""catch 22.""  I guess I'd rather marry someone I didn't love.  Being married to someone who didn't love me  is something I can't even imagine; that would be awful.  to marry someone I didn't love would be bad...real bad..but I think it would be a bit better than the alternative."
13926,Prompt,Would you rather marry someone who does not love you or marry someone you do not love?
13927,General Response,"Oh, no... I wouldn't want to marry anybody who didn't love me! And I wouldn't want to marry someone I didn't love! But if this is a must answer kind of thing, I'm going to have to say that I would marry someone I didn't love. Think about it, if you marry someone who loves you and you live in happy, healthy, safe conditions, then there is at least a chance you will be okay. And, who knows, maybe I would learn to love that person."
13928,Prompt,Would you rather marry someone who does not love you or marry someone you do not love?
13929,General Response,Marry someone I don't love would probably be easier for me as a person to deal with. If you married someone who didn't love you I feel like it would be a constant worry to try and make them or you constantly doubting yourself and trying to make up excuses as to why they don't love you and how they could. At least if you are the one who is not in love it's something you could deal with yourself. It's an internal issue that you could deal with and process on your own. Rather then having to constantly ask yourself why someone else doesn't feel like you do.
13930,Prompt,Would you rather marry someone who does not love you or marry someone you do not love?
13931,General Response,I would rather marry someone who does not love me. I guess it wouldnt hurt as much if I was the one who was not loved.
13932,Prompt,Would you rather marry someone who does not love you or marry someone you do not love?
13933,General Response,"With those choices, I would rather marry someone who I do not love, because affection can develop over time so there is a chance I would grow to love him as mush as he loved me."
13934,Prompt,Would you rather always have to skip everywhere or run everywhere?
13935,General Response,"I'd rather run everywhere. Skipping is fun when you are a child, but its awkward looking as an adult."
13936,Prompt,Would you rather always have to skip everywhere or run everywhere?
13937,General Response,"I guess if I had to pick I would rather skip everywhere because, to be honest run is not in my vocabulary.  Plus, if you run everywhere you miss so much."
13938,Prompt,Would you rather always have to skip everywhere or run everywhere?
13939,General Response,"I would rather skip everywhere I think, mostly because I hate running."
13940,Prompt,Would you rather always have to skip everywhere or run everywhere?

13948,Prompt,Would you rather look strong and be weak or look weak and be strong?
13949,General Response,"I'd definitely rather look weak and be strong. Then nobody will see it coming. if somebody ever picked a fight with you they would assume that you'd be so easy to beat, and then BAM, you prove them wrong. Everybody will be so amazed with how strong you are. I think even if I had the choice to look strong and be strong, I'd still rather look weak."
13950,Prompt,Would you rather look strong and be weak or look weak and be strong?
13951,General Response,"I would want to look weak and be strong, that way I could surprise my attacker! It would make a cool party trick too!"
13952,Prompt,Would you rather look strong and be weak or look weak and be strong?
13953,General Response,Id rather look strong. Appearance is everything and even if your weak inside no one will know if you give a strong appearance and it can make you stronger on the inside

13964,Prompt,Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction books?

13966,Prompt,Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction books?
13967,General Response,"I always studied science a lot while in college, so I was into nonfiction books. I usually prefer books that are realistic."

13969,General Response,I prefer fiction because I can get lost in the story. It helps to take my mind off things.
13970,Prompt,Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction books?
13971,General Response,I prefer fiction books to nonfiction because fiction usually packs more entertainment value than nonfiction
13972,Prompt,Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction books?

13974,Prompt,How often do you curse?
13975,General Response,"How often I curse depends entirely on the situation and who I'm around. I rarely curse around adult relatives and never around children, but I curse fairly frequently around friends and my brother."
13976,Prompt,How often do you curse?
13977,General Response,"I rarely curse, and when I do it's most likely just for comedic purposes. I'm proud to have a fairly extensive vocabulary that narrowly borders on pedantic. If I were to insult someone, I'd most likely refer to them as some type of monosyllabic, troglodytic sycophant that smells of bacon. And not the good kind of bacon, mind you, but rather the greenish, bubbly shreds of pseudo swine flesh you'd find amidst the past-prime detritus surrounding the nearest Burger King dumpster. If I happen to become angry I do not speak at all, and that's more terrifying to anyone who knows me well enough to avoid the daggers lancing from my eyes."
13978,Prompt,How often do you curse?
13979,General Response,"Probably too often! I curse like a saylor and I don't know how I ever staryed because I didn't hear much profanity growing up. I guess maybe that's why, making up for losg time!"
13980,Prompt,How often do you curse?
13981,General Response,"More than I care to admit. My fiancee is always telling me to not curse so much. I have cut back a lot, but still do more than I don't."
13982,Prompt,How often do you curse?
13983,General Response,"I curse all of the time, I am horrible at controlling it.  This is not a good thing because my older 2 boys have picked up on it and I am dreading them starting school."
13984,Prompt,Would you rather have a terrible short-term memory or forget everything bad that ever happened to you?
13985,General Response,I would rather have terrible short-term memory because the bad memories are the ones that are most important to me.
13986,Prompt,Would you rather have a terrible short-term memory or forget everything bad that ever happened to you?
13987,General Response,I'd rather forget everything bad that ever happened to me that way I can keep trying even when I fail.
13988,Prompt,Would you rather have a terrible short-term memory or forget everything bad that ever happened to you?
13989,General Response,"I would rather have a terrible short term memory because, you can always right stuff down. I would not want to forget everything bad or I might make the same mistakes again!"
13990,Prompt,Would you rather have a terrible short-term memory or forget everything bad that ever happened to you?
13991,General Response,"I would rather forget everything bad that has happened to me than have a terrible short term memory.  Sometimes in life it's the bad memories that can haunt you. So, if I had the choice, I'd rather forget the bad stuff."
13992,Prompt,Would you rather have a terrible short-term memory or forget everything bad that ever happened to you?
13993,General Response,"I already have terrible short-term memory! I think, if giving up all of the bad memories would fix that issue, I would probably stick with having a terrible short-term memory. I can deal with that, but forgetting all of the bad would make some of the good that came after the bad less special."
13994,Prompt,Would you rather be an actor/actress in a movie or in a television show?
13995,General Response,I'd rather be in a TV show because it would be more work in the end but I'd have fewer lines to memorize at a time.

13997,General Response,Would rather be an actor in a television show because there would potentially be a longer contract for a higher salary.
13998,Prompt,Would you rather be an actor/actress in a movie or in a television show?
13999,General Response,I think I would rather be in a television show because it's a continuous thing. You get to play out different scenarios on different days and you get to really get to know your character rather than just one story like in a movie!
14000,Prompt,Would you rather be an actor/actress in a movie or in a television show?
14001,General Response,"I would rather be an actress in a television show than in a movie. While a movie would be a job where you finish the job and you're done, a television show has the potential to go on for years and could be a more steady income coming in. With a large family like ours (four children), it's important to have a steady income."
14002,Prompt,Would you rather be an actor/actress in a movie or in a television show?
14003,General Response,I would rather be an actor in a movie because I would be paid more. And not have to do too much work.

14008,Prompt,What is the best / worst thing about your work / school?
14009,General Response,The best thing about my work is that I work from home.  I don't have any commute at all.  The worst thing is not socializing and it can sometimes be isolating to work from home.

14018,Prompt,What cartoons did you watch as a child?

14020,Prompt,What cartoons did you watch as a child?
14021,General Response,I loved watching Tom & Jerry as a kid. I always loved animals and for a short time believed the cartoons were real.
14022,Prompt,What cartoons did you watch as a child?

14024,Prompt,"Would you rather never eat your favorite food for the rest of your life, or only be able to eat your favorite food?"
14025,General Response,"I would rather never be about to eat my favorite food--I think if I only ate it, I would soon grow to hate it."
14026,Prompt,"Would you rather never eat your favorite food for the rest of your life, or only be able to eat your favorite food?"
14027,General Response,I would rather to not eat my favorite food because if I was only able to eat my favorite food that would limit my diet
14028,Prompt,"Would you rather never eat your favorite food for the rest of your life, or only be able to eat your favorite food?"
14029,General Response,I would rather never eat my favorite food because good diets require some sort of variety.
14030,Prompt,"Would you rather never eat your favorite food for the rest of your life, or only be able to eat your favorite food?"

14032,Prompt,"Would you rather never eat your favorite food for the rest of your life, or only be able to eat your favorite food?"
14033,General Response,"I would rather be able to eat my favorite food for the rest of my life. To eat food that you love is apart of enjoying and living your life. To have food that is not your favorite, you may want to eat less, and think not to eat as often."
14034,Prompt,Would you rather be feared than loved?

14036,Prompt,Would you rather be feared than loved?
14037,General Response,"Not a chance. My daughter means the world to me, and until she was born I had never experienced pure, unconditional love. I've achieved the rank of Rokudan in kendo, and have black belts in jiu jitsu, judo, and aikido, so in a manner of speaking I suppose you could say I've been feared, as I've attended many tournaments and sparred in numerous matches. Still, I would choose to be loved over feared any day."
14038,Prompt,Would you rather be feared than loved?
14039,General Response,"Absolutely not. I think being loved is one of the most valuable experiences in life. Being feared commands respect, and can generate power, but it does not complete a person."
14040,Prompt,Would you rather be feared than loved?
14041,General Response,Feared as love is fleeting. Fear will stick to a person if properly deployed.
14042,Prompt,Would you rather be feared than loved?
14043,General Response,I would much rather be loved. It is against human nature to prefer fear. I think that is a sign of a psychosis. Humans gravitate towards others instinctively.
14044,Prompt,"If you were a king / queen, what would your throne look like?"
14045,General Response,"It would be soft, with lots of pillows and it would recline into a bed. I don't need it to be fancy, I would just want it to be comfortable! Queens can take naps whenever they want, right?"

14047,General Response,My throne would be plush and comfortable with soft fabric. It would have turquoise fabric.

14050,Prompt,"If you were a king / queen, what would your throne look like?"
14051,General Response,"My throne would be purple and gold, like most thrones used to be, but the material would be the softest material my servants could find me."
14052,Prompt,"If you were a king / queen, what would your throne look like?"
14053,General Response,"If I had a throne, it would be made out of the most fluffy and expensive materials."

14056,Prompt,Where is the weirdest place you have seen someone you know?
14057,General Response,"The weirdest place I have ever seen someone I know would have to be 11 hours from home at a restaurant in Indiana. It seemed ironic to me that the two of us were there at the same time, 11 hours from where we both live."

14074,Prompt,Would you rather have your first child when you are 18 years old or when you are 40 years old?
14075,General Response,"That's one of the more interesting questions I've been asked.  There are disadvantages in either case, but I'd prefer having my first child at the age of 40.  I realize that's kind of old to become a parent.  But by 40, I would have learned a lot about many things and I'd be able to pass on that knowledge to my child.  I just think that 18 is too young to become a parent.  I know it can be done, and there are some great 18 year old parents.  But too many things can go wrong."
14076,Prompt,Would you rather have your first child when you are 18 years old or when you are 40 years old?
14077,General Response,"As someone who had their first child at the ripe old age of 21, I can definitely say I'd rather have my first child at 18. By the time you're 40, they're only 22. You're still young when they're going off to college, so I definitely think it's the right choice."
14078,Prompt,Would you rather have your first child when you are 18 years old or when you are 40 years old?
14079,General Response,I would rather have my first child when I am 40 because I would be in a better position to take care of it.
14080,Prompt,Would you rather have your first child when you are 18 years old or when you are 40 years old?
14081,General Response,Having a child when you're younger is definitely the better choice! I had my first when I was 22 and I can't imagine having one at 40. How old would you be when your child was 18 and leaving the house?
14082,Prompt,Would you rather have your first child when you are 18 years old or when you are 40 years old?
14083,General Response,"I would rather have my first child at 40 because I think it is difficult to fully care for a child when you are barely an adult yourself.  If I had had a child when I was 18, I would have missed out on things I did back then, like going to college and other things that helped me to develop into a responsible adult."
14084,Prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Alien or Predator?"
14085,General Response,Alien would win because they have special powers we cannot understand at this time.

14110,Prompt,Do you like riding your bicycle? Why or why not?
14111,General Response,"I haven't been on a bike since I was a kid, but I used to love riding to places before I could drive. Now it seems like a lot of work."
14112,Prompt,Do you like riding your bicycle? Why or why not?
14113,General Response,"No, I do not like riding my bicycle anymore. I have back issues and riding my bike seems to make it worse."
14114,Prompt,Do you have any pets? Why? Or why not?
14115,General Response,"I don't have pets because eventually they die, so why get attached to something that costs money if it won't ever give you a return and only make you feel sad."
14116,Prompt,Do you have any pets? Why? Or why not?
14117,General Response,"We have an aquarium with saltwater fish.  We enjoy the hobby of caring for and watching the fish. It is a lot more work and expense that we originally expected, but now that we are so invested, there's no turning back."

14122,Prompt,Do you have any pets? Why? Or why not?
14123,General Response,I do not own any pets. The place i stay at i would have to put down a deposit and its a 200 deposit so i dont have the money for that.

14125,General Response,"I was never able to learn to ride a horse, but I would love to learn. It seems like a very freeing experience."
14126,Prompt,"Can you ride a horse? If not, do you want to learn?"
14127,General Response,"I cannot ride a horse, but it would nice to learn how to ride one. You never know when you'll be stranded at a ranch with no car during an apocalypse."
14128,Prompt,"Can you ride a horse? If not, do you want to learn?"
14129,General Response,"I rode on a horse a few times in my youth, I think it's a good skill that everyone should have or at least experience a few times."
14130,Prompt,"Can you ride a horse? If not, do you want to learn?"
14131,General Response,"I have never ridden a horse, but I would love to learn.  I would just need a really good teacher, because I might be afraid if I got so close to a big animal."
14132,Prompt,"Can you ride a horse? If not, do you want to learn?"
14133,General Response,"No, I can't ride a horse, I have been on one before, but it's kind of scary sitting up so high."
14134,Prompt,What apps have changed your life a lot?
14135,General Response,"Scanner Radio has changed my life a lot.  It's from Broadcastify.  I listen to it, especially during the winter, to find out about road conditions before leaving for work.  It also has opened my eyes to just how much crime is going on in my city and where it is happening at."
14136,Prompt,What apps have changed your life a lot?

14138,Prompt,What apps have changed your life a lot?

It's amazing! The Apple Health app keeps track of my exercise, I am able to track my steps, how many miles I have walked/ran, and if I did any flights of stairs or not!"
14140,Prompt,What apps have changed your life a lot?
14141,General Response,"Scanable is the first one that comes to mind. Last year we about a house and along with that come a ton of paperwork, copies that need to be sent, things that need signed and sent again. Scanable made the process so much easier. The app scans each page of a document, cleans it up, and either saves or shares it. I could send everything to the bank or our agent in a matter of minutes right from my gmail."
14142,Prompt,What apps have changed your life a lot?
14143,General Response,The App ESPN has changed my life a lot because it has helped me stop watching so much sports by just getting alert notifications to my phone.
14144,Prompt,Would you rather be stranded on an island with someone you hate or stranded on an island alone?

Plus, with someone else there, I'll have someone to talk to and we could work together to get home. Another plus, if I hate them then I get to watch them suffer too."
14150,Prompt,Would you rather be stranded on an island with someone you hate or stranded on an island alone?
14151,General Response,I would rather be stranded on an island alone because I would not want to have to take care of someone that I don't like.
14152,Prompt,Would you rather be stranded on an island with someone you hate or stranded on an island alone?
14153,General Response,"I would be stranded on an island with someone I hate because I think my chance of survival would be better if I wasn't alone.  You never know, we might actually begin to like one another after a while."
14154,Prompt,"Would you rather have a very muscular lower body and a normal upper body, or a muscular upper body but a very skinny lower body?"

14156,Prompt,"Would you rather have a very muscular lower body and a normal upper body, or a muscular upper body but a very skinny lower body?"

14158,Prompt,"Would you rather have a very muscular lower body and a normal upper body, or a muscular upper body but a very skinny lower body?"
14159,General Response,"I would rather have a muscular upper body than a muscular lower body. I am always doing things like lifting and reaching. I am also rather flat-chested, so some padding behind there would help me fill out tops nicely. Bumpy legs are rather unsightly in my opinion. I would imagine they would be a pain to shave!"
14160,Prompt,"Would you rather have a very muscular lower body and a normal upper body, or a muscular upper body but a very skinny lower body?"
14161,General Response,A strong upper body and a skinny lower body because I have a bad leg and the weight loss and being skinny would lessen my pain and the stronger arms could be useful in excerzing since I am limited by what i can do with lower bod with leg and back pain.
14162,Prompt,"Would you rather have a very muscular lower body and a normal upper body, or a muscular upper body but a very skinny lower body?"
14163,General Response,I'd rather have a muscular upper body because having strong arms and shoulders and chest would help me do physical chores more easily

14169,General Response,"I'd rather sing. I'm not much for standing up in front of people and giving a speech, but I'm not afraid to sing in front of people. My voice isn't the worst you've ever heard."
14170,Prompt,Would you rather be able to sing like diva or be able to play the guitar like a rock star?
14171,General Response,I would rather be able to sing. Singers stand out much more than guitar players who can easily be replaced if needed. When is singer is changed the whole sound of a group can change as well. I'm much more likely to be known being a singer if I ever made it big in the music industry.
14172,Prompt,Would you rather be able to sing like diva or be able to play the guitar like a rock star?
14173,General Response,"Playing an instrument give one more career options. You could take that talent and teach it to others, thus get paid to be a music teacher or tutor. Singing is very market oriented. Talent in singing is not the sole driver of success. There is a lot of balance that one loses if they choose to enter that sphere."
14174,Prompt,What is your favorite thing to do on the weekend?
14175,General Response,"On the weekend, I like to really get out and explore the outdoors. I like to hike, canoe and backpack. If I can't, like if I'm sick, I'll stay in and watch movies."
14176,Prompt,What is your favorite thing to do on the weekend?

14178,Prompt,What is your favorite thing to do on the weekend?
14179,General Response,"Funnily enough, my favorite thing to do on the weekend is nothing. The weekend allows me to recharge my batteries so to speak."
14180,Prompt,What is your favorite thing to do on the weekend?
14181,General Response,"My favorite thing to do on the weekend is rest and binge watch my favorite TV shows.  Lately, I am finding that I have seen so many of the shows available on demand, that it is becoming difficult to find new shows that I want to see."
14182,Prompt,What is your favorite thing to do on the weekend?
14183,General Response,"First things first, relax a little. And then, of course hang out with my kids and husband...my hubby and I both work two jobs during the week we have to catch on family time as much as we can on the weekends."

14187,General Response,I'd rather be famous for my singing because I already enjoy doing it and do it often.
14188,Prompt,Would you rather be famous for your dancing or famous for your singing?
14189,General Response,"Since I am terrible at both of these things, I like this question. I'll go with dancing. Thanks to shows like The Voice and America's Got Talent, singing talent has become more and more prominent, or at least more people have become famous because of it. I think being famous for my dancing would make me more of a novelty, and I wouldn't mind being able to kill it at weddings."
14190,Prompt,Would you rather be famous for your dancing or famous for your singing?
14191,General Response,That's a good one! I think I'd rather be famous for my dancing. I love to dance as a way to express myself but also because it makes me feel like I'm free without a care in the world but to feel good dancing to an amazing beat!
14192,Prompt,Would you rather be famous for your dancing or famous for your singing?
14193,General Response,"I could potentially be famous for my singing, because I am classically trained to do so."
14194,Prompt,What do you like to do in spring?

14196,Prompt,What do you like to do in spring?
14197,General Response,"In spring, I like to look outside and look at the plants coming back to life and new flowers and leaves appearing."

14206,Prompt,"If you had intro music, what song would it be? Why?"
14207,General Response,"If I had to choose something, I think i'd pick the theme song to the original MacGyver TV series.  It starts off sort of analytical, then picks up as if a solution is found, then goes full-on music when the action starts."
14208,Prompt,"If you had intro music, what song would it be? Why?"
14209,General Response,"My intro music would be ""Rockstar"" by Smashmouth. Because I'm a rockstar. No not really my intro music would be classical music because I am very fancy."
14210,Prompt,"If you had intro music, what song would it be? Why?"
14211,General Response,"It would be a song by the band Thursday. I do not know what song, but that is my favorite band, so it makes sense that my intro music or theme song would be performed by them!"
14212,Prompt,"If you had intro music, what song would it be? Why?"
14213,General Response,"my intro music would be ""A change is going to come.""  This let's everyone know that the world don't stand still for no one."
14214,Prompt,Would you rather be as tall as you are wide or as wide as you are tall?
14215,General Response,I'd rather be tall as I am wide. Could you imagine how big doors and houses would have to be if everyone was as wide as they are tall?? Of course I'm not very wide which means stairs and driving would be really hard for me if I was only a foot-ish tall!
14216,Prompt,Would you rather be as tall as you are wide or as wide as you are tall?
14217,General Response,Definitely as tall as wide. I don't wanna sit around and not enjoy life because I'm to big to get around anymore. I'd just be a little man!
14218,Prompt,Would you rather be as tall as you are wide or as wide as you are tall?
14219,General Response,"Perhaps neither, but tall as you are wide at least seems to be in better proportions. As wide as you are tall, which almost sounds the same, at makes one seem larger, more obese."
14220,Prompt,Would you rather be as tall as you are wide or as wide as you are tall?
14221,General Response,I'd probably want to be as wide as I am tall. The first option would make me pretty short.
14222,Prompt,Would you rather be as tall as you are wide or as wide as you are tall?
14223,General Response,As tall as I am wide.  I amy small now and I meet both qualifications anyway!
14224,Prompt,Would you rather have a pig nose or a monkey face?
14225,General Response,"A pig nose may be more fun than a monkey face, as being a ""pig-man"" was the subject of a Seinfeld TV show episode."
14226,Prompt,Would you rather have a pig nose or a monkey face?
14227,General Response,I think I would rather have a pig face. At least then the rest of my face could be normal. I could even hide it like that girl in the movie Penelope. A monkey face would be so much harder to hide! Plus I think that would include fur and I don't need any more personal grooming to do.
14228,Prompt,Would you rather have a pig nose or a monkey face?
14229,General Response,I would rather have a monkey face because pigs are so disgusting and have very ugly noses.
14230,Prompt,Would you rather have a pig nose or a monkey face?
14231,General Response,"I would rather have monkey face because pigs are ugly, and at least some monkeys are cute."
14232,Prompt,Would you rather have a pig nose or a monkey face?
14233,General Response,"I would rather have a monkey face. I think a pig nose could be annoying, and I'd rather have a face that looked incorrect for my species but put together than a patchwork looking face, even if most of it was normal."
14234,Prompt,Would you rather be the star basketball player on your schools losing team or sit on the bench all season with your schools winning team?

14236,Prompt,Would you rather be the star basketball player on your schools losing team or sit on the bench all season with your schools winning team?
14237,General Response,"Of course sit on the bench. I gotta let my team win and give them support. I mean come on, nobody likes a sore loser."
14238,Prompt,Would you rather be the star basketball player on your schools losing team or sit on the bench all season with your schools winning team?
14239,General Response,"No doubt about it; I'd rather be the star player on a losing team.  I'd be very popular, my self-esteem would rise, and all in all I'd have a very good time.  sure, it would be frustrating to lose more than the team won.  but still, I'd get a lot of attention and I'd enjoy that.  Now let me say that the ideal situation would be to be an important player...not the star player...on a good team.  that way I'd get personal attention and enjoy winning.  but given the options you gave me, I'd prefer being the star on a losing team."
14240,Prompt,Would you rather be the star basketball player on your schools losing team or sit on the bench all season with your schools winning team?
14241,General Response,I would rather sit on the bench of my school's winning team because I don't enjoy basketball very much.
14242,Prompt,Would you rather be the star basketball player on your schools losing team or sit on the bench all season with your schools winning team?
14243,General Response,I would be happy sitting on the bench all season with the my schools winning team. I don't really like sports so I'd rather be on the sidelines than playing the game.
14244,Prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Terminator, Robocop, or Alexa?"
14245,General Response,Alexa would definitely not win. That is just an app. It is silly to say it would win.
14246,Prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Terminator, Robocop, or Alexa?"
14247,General Response,Terminator would win in a fight because he is from the future and has superior defense and weaponry.
14248,Prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Terminator, Robocop, or Alexa?"
14249,General Response,I think Robocop would win the fight because he is programmed to sense crime.
14250,Prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Terminator, Robocop, or Alexa?"
14251,General Response,Alexa! She'd wrap the other two completely around her finger and win that way for sure.
14252,Prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Terminator, Robocop, or Alexa?"
14253,General Response,I think Alexa would win a fight with the Terminator and Robocop. Alexa has the capacity of the entire internet. This is more knowledge that both Robocop and Terminator. With this Alexa will surely outsmart the machines.
14254,Prompt,Would you rather live around a noisy neighbor or a barking dog?
14255,General Response,"A barking dog. I can forgive the dog, it doesn't know how it affects people. But a noisy neighbor should know better."

14444,Prompt,Do movies have the same power as books to change the world?
14445,General Response,"I was reading somewhere that the movie industry made something like $38.6 billion dollars globally last year. And when you think about how many people it took to get a number like that, you've got to say that movies are having at least some impact on the world. But, I would have to argue that it takes a really special movie to have a deeply profound impact on the world just like it takes a special book."
14446,Prompt,Do movies have the same power as books to change the world?
14447,General Response,"Specific movies do, yes. There are a number of movies that live up to the books they're based on, and can be just as powerful. A few examples? To Kill a Mockingbird is right on par with the book and just as moving. To Kill A Mockingbird is amazing in its own right, as the novel is told from the perspective of the Chief, while the movie follows Jack Nicholson's character. Personally, the first movie I saw in theaters was Star Wars, and not only did it change the face of cinema, it became the focal point for my life development."
14448,Prompt,Do movies have the same power as books to change the world?
14449,General Response,"I don't think so, they are both powerful in their own way, one u can create a story and characters through imagination and the other does it for you do can more visualize and enjoy the story."

14452,Prompt,Do movies have the same power as books to change the world?
14453,General Response,"Hmmm...I think it depends on your perspective.  As a librarian, I would say books have more power.  However, my best friend is a big movie buff and she gets more and is motivated more by movies.  We argue about this all the time.  I think that books go more in depth...she feels that she knows the characters better by seeing how they are portrayed on screen."
14454,Prompt,"You find a remote that can rewind, fast forward, stop and start time. What do you do with it?"

14456,Prompt,"You find a remote that can rewind, fast forward, stop and start time. What do you do with it?"

14458,Prompt,"You find a remote that can rewind, fast forward, stop and start time. What do you do with it?"

14460,Prompt,"You find a remote that can rewind, fast forward, stop and start time. What do you do with it?"
14461,General Response,"If I found a magical time machine remote, I'd first rewind, and go back to all my favorite memories and watch them. Next, I'd fast forward and check out the future. I'd probably go to multiple dates in the future just to see how much things change. I don't think I'd use the start or stop buttons, but a pause or mute button would be a nice addition to the remote!"
14462,Prompt,"You find a remote that can rewind, fast forward, stop and start time. What do you do with it?"
14463,General Response,"I rewind to the past and murder every horrible dictator while time was paused, and I do the same for all atrocities, then I fast forward to the future and enjoy their technology."
14464,Prompt,Do you experience phantom vibration? (Feeling your phone vibrate even though it did not.)
14465,General Response,"Sometimes I get the feeling that my phone is vibrating and can even check my phone multiple times before I decide it's definitely not my phone vibrating. Even then, after I tell myself it's definitely not mine, I still can't help myself from checking my phone. Am I that desperate for a text? Maybe."

14491,General Response,"When I was a senior in high school I worked at a water park in Palm Springs, California where I was a lifeguard. I had to be alert and yes at times I was needed for issues, but for the most part I just sat back and got paid to get a tan and go in the water."

14501,General Response,"records are classy because they are vintage but the sound quality isnt that great. CDs are convenient because you can play them almost anywhere, but they are fragile.

14502,Prompt,"Records, tapes, CDs, MP3s. Which did you grow up with? What is good and bad about each?"
14503,General Response,I grew up with CD's and they were not very good. CD's are limited to the amount of music you can play on them. I prefer devices which have the capacity to hold many more songs that will fit my daily moods.

14573,General Response,"If I could have any pet I would have a cat because I have had cats in the past and I really like them, and they are self sufficient, so if you're the kind of person who can't be home during the day to give them a walk they are fine."

Before people were forced to look through pages for information and now it is much more accessible without much thinking or pursuing.
14582,Prompt,Do you think people read more or less books now than 50 years ago?
14583,General Response,"I think the instinctive answer is to say no. At first thought, we have so many other forms of entertainment that it seems that books are dying out.

14622,Prompt,"What is the one thing you cannot do, no matter how hard you try?"
14623,General Response,"I cannot tie my grocery bags the way they do at Asian stores.

14633,General Response,I like the facebook app because I can connect with my friends and share recipes and see pictures of each others families and learn new ways of doing things.

14709,General Response,"Well, hopefully I won't have anymore first dates, if you know what I mean! However, if I had to make this choice, starting over with a new relationship, I'd say something relaxed. I'd probably start with like, a fancy dinner in one of those restaurants with the dim lights so he doesn't see me stuffing my face full of delicious charcuteries. Then after dinner, maybe bowling or rock climbing. I'd love to see my date sweat! Plus it'd be important to break him in now to my active lifestyle, ya know? I'd hate to lead him on, thinking I'm okay with just sitting at home on the weekends watching tv all day."
14710,Prompt,Where do you like to go on a first date?
14711,General Response,I'd like to go mini golfing on a first date so we're pre-occupied with a fun activity instead of trying to force a conversation. The mini golf could even give us stuff to tease each other and be playful about too.

14719,General Response,"I don't want to lick the bottom of my shoes or eat my boogers! Yucky!!!

They say something like it's got a lot of good bacteria and is good for your teeth and overall health. Yummy, not!"
14720,Prompt,Would you rather lick the bottom of your shoe or eat your boogers?
14721,General Response,"Eat my own boogers. At least they came from my body, I would just be putting them back. The bottom of my shoe could have YOUR boogers on it."
14722,Prompt,Would you rather lick the bottom of your shoe or eat your boogers?

14731,General Response,The most disgusting thing I have heard about happening in a restaurant is a worker spitting in someone's food.  I think this is totally disgusting.  It is also one reason why I try not to complain or be rude to people who are preparing my food.
14732,Prompt,What is the most disgusting thing you have heard about that happened at a restaurant?

14740,Prompt,What food looks disgusting but tastes delicious?
14741,General Response,I think that any kind of chocolate balls look disgusting but they taste good. There's a lot of imagery that one could associate chocolate balls with so it's just hard for me I guess.
14742,Prompt,What food looks disgusting but tastes delicious?
14743,General Response,"Goat brains both look and sound kind of gross, but the taste is amazing. It's one of my favorite things to eat."
14744,Prompt,What is the best show currently on TV?

14746,Prompt,What is the best show currently on TV?
14747,General Response,"My favorite show on TV right now is It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It's got a unique brand of humor that's kind of dark, but real witting and funny. It's probably the most original show on TV right now."

14776,Prompt,How do you think traveling to a lot of different countries changes a person?
14777,General Response,"I would think so. I mean it could make you more aware of the world in a personal way. I guess it could also be bad, if you happen to go to a country with civil unrest, or just flat out hatred for our country.

14792,Prompt,"If your life was a meal, what would kind of meal would it be?"
14793,General Response,"I'm not sure if you mean meal time or the actual meal so I'll answer both ways. 1.

14804,Prompt,Do you like classical music?

14815,General Response,I would rather be famous and remembered with hatred because being known is better than not being known at all.
14816,Prompt,Would you rather be famous and remembered with hatred or unknown and forgotten?

14819,General Response,"Famous, for even if hated, your memory lives on through the fame far longer."
14820,Prompt,Would you rather be famous and remembered with hatred or unknown and forgotten?
14821,General Response,"I would rather be unknown and forgotten, than famous and remembered with hatred. For the most part, I'm a loving person in my everyday life--I try to treat everyone with respect. What's the point of being famous, if you treat everyone worst than garbage."
14822,Prompt,Would you rather be famous and remembered with hatred or unknown and forgotten?

14832,Prompt,Would you rather always smell rotten meat or always smell skunk?
14833,General Response,"I would rather smell skunk. I'm from the country and even though they smell awful, it's not the same as rotting meat. Bad meat would make me gag."

14872,Prompt,Would you rather be able to sleep as late as you wish or be able to stay up as late as you like?
14873,General Response,"Honestly, I guess I'd have to say that the ability to sleep in is better. The thing is, when you stay up late, you already want to sleep in, so ultimately, probably sleeping in is more important."
14874,Prompt,Would you rather always have your favorite song stuck in your head forever or always dream the same thing at night?
14875,General Response,"I think dream the same thing at night because I could always think of ways to change what I do in the dream, having the song stuck in my head I think I would want to hurt someone I mean have you had Let it go in your head...thats just insane"

14920,Prompt,Why are you burned out from your job?
14921,General Response,I work with preschoolers and have for ten years. I burn out becuase the demands on the teacher for 4 year olds and the testing requirements for four yr olds I don't agree with and many children are not ready for these academic tasks at this young age. Also the behavior challenges of children gets worse every year from the lack of discipline and parenting in childrens lives. Technology has made kids want everything instantly and they have no patience for pausing for a second or reading a book and become increasingly bored of tasks that do not have instant gratification or are not digital or tv based or internet based.
14922,Prompt,Why are you burned out from your job?

14934,Prompt,Would you rather eat a small can of dog food or six overripe bananas?
14935,General Response,"Overripe bananas are actually sweeter and taste so much better - at least to me at any rate. I couldn't imagine eating the smallest can of dog food unless there was some serious money involved. At the *very* least four digits. No, no...I'll take the bananas please."
14936,Prompt,Would you rather eat a small can of dog food or six overripe bananas?

14947,General Response,"An event in my life that defied explanation was when my mother called me in the early morning hours of August 26, 2012 and told me my brother had been murdered.  I was speechless.  I was in such shock that I couldn't even cry for days."
14948,Prompt,Was there ever an event in your life that defied explanation?
14949,General Response,"There was this one person I used to know that had lived a double life, and she had never told me about it.

14956,Prompt,Where do you get your recommendations for what to do and where to stay when you travel?

14960,Prompt,Where do you get your recommendations for what to do and where to stay when you travel?

I'll check online or google things too but if I have a friend or someone knows someone who had an experience somewhere, I'll always value their opinion.

15015,General Response,"Nurses to change your sheets, warm meals, and exercise time. I can get that at both a nursing home and at a jail, so the tiebreaker for me would have to be Bingo. I don't think I would get much of that at the jail, so nursing home it is."

15018,Prompt,Would you rather spend 2 months living in a nursing home or two months in jail?
15019,General Response,"I would rather spend two months in a nursing home, because I worked in one. I am a realist and aging is a part of life that we all need to better get in touch with. I don't think incarceration is necessary something that we need to experience to make us better. I have acquaintances that work in the jail and have explained to me the realities of jails in America."
15020,Prompt,Would you rather spend 2 months living in a nursing home or two months in jail?
15021,General Response,2 months living in a nursing home. I'd at least have freedom to move around and have friends to talk to. I don't know if you are allowed to move around and have friends in jail. Plus I hear the food is better in a nursing home!

15030,Prompt,Would you rather be locked inside an old building with your boyfriend/girlfriend or inside an amusement park with a celebrity?
15031,General Response,"Wait, can I pick this celebrity? Just joking, I'd rather be locked inside an amusement park with a celebrity. I could ask them so many questions."
15032,Prompt,Would you rather be locked inside an old building with your boyfriend/girlfriend or inside an amusement park with a celebrity?

I'm 61 years old and still remember this."

I'd probably be happier this way even if I am stressed out a lot."
15182,Prompt,Would you rather have a job that requires very little work but it boring or work very hard at an interesting job?
15183,General Response,The interesting job. Most likely you wouldn't be able to pass the time at a boring job with little work playing games or surfing the web. I would love to keep busy. I just have to hope that the pay is great.

And I couldn't stand to think what bodily fluids must have been sprayed all over the place. But the best hotel I've ever stayed at... huh... Well, I was still probably worried about bodily fluids. Just because it costs a lot and is all fancy doesn't mean people don't get up to all sorts of things!"

Once again, my family was traveling and we randomly came across this hotel (the two times we booked a hotel right on the spot ended up being the best and worst hotels. We almost always book hotels in advance). The room was a huge Indonesian style villa with it's own little private pool.

In 30 minutes this show and others like it show us plain decent human compassion and behavior.  The most overrated show is Keeping up with the Kardachians because these are just spoiled rich girls getting attention because of their nasty and spoiled ways.  They are getting rich just because they are on a show acting like bimbos.  We all deal with these same issues every day but these girls as I call them because real women with self respect wouldn't act that way are getting millions just because they are on tv and we want to watch the chaos.  If you like chaos so much just look out your back door!

I don't recall any favorite restaurants from my childhood. Back then (way back in the fifties and early sixties) people didn't take their children out to restaurants very often.

I mean who wants to be an adult for like forever. Wouldn't it be so awesome to be a teenager forever. Young energetic and spry. The world would totally be my play ground. And technically I wouldn't be an adult, so i wouldn't have all the burdens and annoyances that come with adult life."
15740,Prompt,Would you rather stay forever at your current age or be 10 years younger?

15762,Prompt,Would you rather get everything you want materially or find your true love?
15763,General Response,"I would rather find my true love. It would be nice to have every random thing that I ever think I want, but things can't replace the unconditional love from a person that you think the world of. Things aren't going to be there to bring you chicken soup on the couch when you're sick, or hold your hand when you're walking through the park on a perfect spring day. Love is much more important than things."

15782,Prompt,Are you a very organized person?
15783,General Response,"Sad to say, I am definitely not very organized.  I constantly lose things, and sometimes it's very frustrating.  I blame part of this on the aging process; I'm sixty-one years old and my memory just isn't as good as it used to be.  Misplacing things has become more common to me.  but I can't blame it all on aging.  I've never been real organized; in fact I've always been somewhat careless, especially with unimportant things.  There are some good things about me.  being organized is not one of them."

15799,General Response,Absolutely not! I mean I get it you put your body through hell and you have a lot of tough things your body has to go through but seriously?

People who work labor intensive jobs probably do that much work if not more and they aren't getting paid that much.
15800,Prompt,Do athletes deserve the high salaries they receive? Why or why not?

15814,Prompt,What is the worst thing your mom caught you doing as a kid?
15815,General Response,"My mother was always very busy with my siblings and with her work and with my father, that she missed me a lot growing up. She preferred her children grown and independent. I think the worst thing she may have faced was overhearing my criticizing her to my cousin.

Luckily I was able to hang over the boat and reach as far as I could down into the water and reach the womans hair. We rowed them to shore and they were both saved. This was very hard for a 10 year old."
16110,Prompt,Have you ever saved an animals life? How about a persons life?

All of a sudden it started doing barrel rolls and landed right side up right next to the little cement barriers that divide the highway you know? I had came to a screeching halt, ran out and took their pulse. Called 911. Waited with them. A taxi of guys coming back from the bar also pulled over and started praying around the person. It was crazy. They barely had a pulse and weren't using a seatbelt, because they were upside down in the drivers seat. I got a call from the offer closing the investigation like a year later telling me they passed away. It was really sad. I'll never forget that moment. I wish I could've done more."

16132,Prompt,Would you rather lose your ability to speak or have to say everything you are thinking?
16133,General Response,"My son has asked me this before, and I stand by my original answer of losing my ability to speak. I can always sign something, or write something down. But I couldn't undue the hurt feelings or lost friendships due to my big mouth.

The worst thing? Apart from being agoraphobic to begin with would be the fear of the unknown. To run into a situation that you hadn't anticipated, so you're left clueless as to how to remove yourself from it."
16142,Prompt,What is the best thing about traveling? How about the worst thing?
16143,General Response,"The best thing about traveling is enjoying different sights from the ones you see every day. However, the worst thing is how expensive it could be."

16151,General Response,If I had to choose between having a dog or a cat as a pet I would definitely choose the cat because they're much more self-sufficient. I don't have the kind of life where I can be home to take the dog out every couple hours.

16153,General Response,"I'd rather have a dog, because I find them less disgusting in comparison to cats."

16160,Prompt,Would you rather set the table before dinner or clean up after dinner?
16161,General Response,I would rather set the table before dinner. The reason I say that is I really dont like doing dishes. Im not very good at it and it always takes me way to long.
16162,Prompt,Would you rather set the table before dinner or clean up after dinner?
16163,General Response,"I would rather set the table before dinner than to clean up afterwards. After dinner, it is later in the day and my belly is full of food. This makes me feel lethargic. I would rather do my part of the work while I still have energy. Which would you rather do?"
16164,Prompt,Would you rather have a dinosaur as a pet or a unicorn?
16165,General Response,"I would much rather have a unicorn as a pet, dinosaurs have really big teeth, yeah i'll pass on that."

16168,Prompt,Would you rather have a dinosaur as a pet or a unicorn?
16169,General Response,"I would rather have a unicorn, because they're so magical and beautiful. Also, a unicorn can be hidden, a dinosaur would be a lot harder to explain as they've been extinct for a while now."

16171,General Response,I would love to have a unicorn as a pet! They have magical powers and can heal people and they're mammals so they're cuddly and stuff.

16176,Prompt,Are you where you thought you would be at this point in your life?
16177,General Response,I don't really think this is where I thought I would be at my age but I guess it's where I'm supposed to be. I have no regrets but I suppose I would've done a few things differently.
16178,Prompt,Are you where you thought you would be at this point in your life?
16179,General Response,"No I'm definitely not where I want to be at this point in my life. I always thought by 38 years old I would have been married with kids working in a job surrounded by family, friends, etc. Instead, after my marriage fell apart 3 years ago my entire life has changed, not for the worse but seemed to have pushed me back in the progress to where I wanted to be."
16180,Prompt,Are you where you thought you would be at this point in your life?
16181,General Response,I was where I thought I shouldve been until I got hurt at work twice and had two surgeries. I was a teacher and they illegally took my contract after two open comp cases.

16182,Prompt,Are you where you thought you would be at this point in your life?

16197,General Response,I would rather have everyone know the details of my finances than the details of my love life because I find that my love life is simply more personal and more revealing about myself and my husband. Either would not be pleasant for sure!

16199,General Response,well both are super private but I rather they know the details of my love life

16219,General Response,I would much rather travel alone. I want to stop when I want and not be on a schedule.
16220,Prompt,Do you prefer traveling alone or with a group?
16221,General Response,"That is tough, because I could enjoy either one equally. I'd say, for the sake of it, that I'd prefer to travel with a group. As a female, I'd feel safer with numbers, and it would allow me to interact with adults which I don't get enough of, in my opinion. Plus, if I needed some alone time I could excuse myself, whereas if I were traveling alone it would be harder to just go make a bunch of friends from random strangers! Can you imagine?"
16222,Prompt,Do you prefer traveling alone or with a group?
16223,General Response,"I don't like groups; it's just my personality. the group would have to be very small for be to be in it.  On the other hand, traveling alone wouldn't be ideal either because it could get very frustrating.  The best option for me would be to travel with my wife; just the two of us.  But if I had to choose between being in a group, or being alone, I'd definitely travel alone.  At the age of 61, I'm tired of big-mouth arrogant ""know it all"" people who can ruin things in a group.  all it takes is one ""bad apple"" to ruin a good experience.  I'd rather go solo."

16230,Prompt,Do you prefer to watch movies in the theater or in the comfort of your own home?
16231,General Response,"I'd rather watch a movie in the theater because the screen is so big, you can get snacks and slushies, and it's a good date activity with my wife."
16232,Prompt,Do you prefer to watch movies in the theater or in the comfort of your own home?

16234,Prompt,"When you travel do you prefer a single carry on backpack, or a full armada of luggage?"
16235,General Response,"Obviously it depends on the destination, but I still pack light regardless.

16240,Prompt,"When you travel do you prefer a single carry on backpack, or a full armada of luggage?"
16241,General Response,"Although I would like to have more items with me than a single carry on backpack can handle, I would prefer the backpack because it would be so much easier to maneuver. I could always grab the things that I could not bring with at a store when I arrived at my destination. It would also save money on luggage fees."
16242,Prompt,"When you travel do you prefer a single carry on backpack, or a full armada of luggage?"
16243,General Response,Whenever i travel i prefer a full armada of luggage because i can't really choose what to carry and what to leave.

16254,Prompt,What are some good and bad things about the education system in your country?
16255,General Response,"One good thing is that it is available free for all children from age 6 to age 18. On the other hand, the bad thing is that like with most things, you get what you pay for. So our kids who are getting a free education oftentimes aren't getting a very good one."
16256,Prompt,What are some good and bad things about the education system in your country?

16258,Prompt,What are some good and bad things about the education system in your country?
16259,General Response,One of the worst things about the education system in the USA is that the quality of the education and funding is highly correlated with wealth class.  Poor people have some of the worst schools.  One good thing is that public schools are free.

16261,General Response,Some good things about the education system in our country is technical. Meaning computers to help us get ahead in the world.

But two of the biggest issues facing schools these days are overcrowding and under-funding."

16272,Prompt,Would you rather have cookies or cake?
16273,General Response,"Shoot, I am a fan of both, but nothing beats a nice cookie from time to time."
16274,Prompt,Would you eat at a restaurant that was really dirty if the food was amazing?
16275,General Response,"No I don't think I could eat at a Restraunt that was dirty, even if they had good food. I ate at a place and my food was really good but there was a gnat that kept flying around until it eventually landed in my food. I haven't been there since."

16281,General Response,"I have eaten at a dirty restaurant that had amazing food! My sister and I went out for sushi and then noticed the sanitation rating :( Thinking about it though, my kitchen is not always the cleanest but I make amazing food. Just because they kitchen is dirty doesn't mean the food or the people preparing the food are dirty. Right?"

16354,Prompt,What piece of technology would look like magic or a miracle to people in medieval Europe?

16381,General Response,"I actually have a recipe for worms, so I would go with that. We have a big colony of frogs that we encourage in our garden. They help with the pest control and so it would be sacrilegious for me to harm a frog. A live one would also be a factor. I would not like to experience their movement in my mouth. It would be impossible!"
16382,Prompt,Would you rather have to eat a bowl full of worms or a live frog?
16383,General Response,"A bowl of live worms seems like a more appealing choice. A live frog would constantly be trying to jump away from you, but worms can't get  anywhere very fast so it would be over quicker."

After twenty-one I left home for the first time, had my first real relationship with a woman, started my career, changed my religious outlook and became a parent.  So many things have happened since I was twenty-one.  In fact, I'm sixty-one now and about to become a first time grandfather.  No doubt about it, a movie about my after the age of twenty-one would be much more interesting."

16426,Prompt,Would you rather have everyone know about your personal finances or know the details of your romantic life?
16427,General Response,I don't think it would bother me if people knew both. I think it would be more of a problem for them being in someone else's private matters.

16456,Prompt,How is life?

16499,General Response,Once there was a radio station that played a song for 24 hours straight. It was pretty obnoxious but tolerable. I hate to ruin a good song that I love and wouldn't ever want to hear again. I guess it depends on how bad that other song I can't control is.
16500,Prompt,Would you rather listen to songs you have no control over 24 hours a day for a year or listen to your favorite song 24 hours a day for a year?
16501,General Response,"I think I would rather listen to songs you have no control instead of my favorite songs for over 24 hours a day for a year, because that way I'd get a variety of different songs and I'm pretty if I listened to the same songs over and over, they wouldn't be my favorite songs anymore; I'd get pretty tired of them."
16502,Prompt,Would you rather listen to songs you have no control over 24 hours a day for a year or listen to your favorite song 24 hours a day for a year?
16503,General Response,"I like to think I play guitar, but other people may have a different opinion on the matter, but music still plays a major role in my life. It's healing, cathartic, and soothing. I like the spontaneity of radio, and when a favorite song starts to play I can't help feel that it's a treat, even though I probably have the CD in my car or the song on my iPhone. Unfortunately, Murphy's Law dictates that less than stellar songs will make it through the air waves and the favorite song will begin when you're thirty seconds from arriving at your destination. I have to have variety, so I would definitely choose to listen to songs I have no control over."

16553,General Response,"It was magical,a kind of feeling that one can only experience to really know it."
16554,Prompt,What do you think of tattoos? Do you have any?
16555,General Response,"I do have a tattoo, and I think they're great. I have a tattoo of a snake on my calf, and a tattoo of my son's name on my chest. I'm looking into getting another one, maybe my other son's name once he's born."
16556,Prompt,What do you think of tattoos? Do you have any?
16557,General Response,"I don't have any tattoos. My thinking is that they are for life, and yet my values, attitudes and body changed as I was growing up, and even though adulthood. A tattoo I selected at age 20 might not be a choice I wanted at age 40. Isn't it better to establish individuality with clothing, hair style, accessories etc? These are changeable, but a tattoo isn't. Okay, laser removal is available, but from what I hear it isn't cheap nor blemish-free.

But that is just me. I know there are others who chose a tattoo and have been happy with it."
16558,Prompt,What do you think of tattoos? Do you have any?
16559,General Response,"I love tattoos, but I don't have any. I'm afraid of that kind of commitment, not afraid of needles. Maybe one day the right tattoo idea will come to mind and I will take the plunge!"
16560,Prompt,What do you think of tattoos? Do you have any?
16561,General Response,"I have one tatoo. I've wanted a tatoo my whole life. Finally, at the age of 54, I got a butterfly tatooed on my leg. Ouch!"
16562,Prompt,What do you think of tattoos? Do you have any?
16563,General Response,"I think tattoos are fine so long as the placement and artwork is aligned with who the person is when they have it done as well as who they are planning to be in the future. Many tattoos are a past self's bad decision that the current or future self will have to deal with. I do have a tattoo, I'm happy with both the design and placement (and patting my past self on the head for being wise enough to have it done where it can't be unless I'm wearing clothes meant to display it.)"
16564,Prompt,"If you could, would you communicate entirely with memes?"
16565,General Response,"Probably, I quite enjoy memes but I think that would be hard task to find the correct meme for every situation and it would be an inappropriate way to communicate."
16566,Prompt,"If you could, would you communicate entirely with memes?"
16567,General Response,"I already pretty much only use memes. Actually, I used to make new ones up all the time, but I got bored of it. Maybe, I should get back into that."
16568,Prompt,"If you could, would you communicate entirely with memes?"
16569,General Response,"As much as I love memes, I don't think I could communicate using just them. I like sending them to people and looking at them and laughing, but I don't see them much as a form of communication. There aren't that many that could be used in everyday conversations. Although, small talk would be so much more bearable if everyone just used memes."
16570,Prompt,"If you could, would you communicate entirely with memes?"
16571,General Response,you can say anything with memes. If I had to I could find a meme saying anything I need it to say or I can make my own.
16572,Prompt,"If you could, would you communicate entirely with memes?"
16573,General Response,No.  I prefer straight forward communication.  Reactions and feelings can only be understood and express through talking.
16574,Prompt,Where is the worst place you have been stuck for a long time?
16575,General Response,"I try to live a life without regrets and I like to see things half full than empty, so this question was at first a little difficult. Then all of a sudden I remembered my very worst working experience! It was in a family run business, where the owners were in such dire financial straights. They were in complete denial that they were in the very worst shape when they decided to hire me on. It was a couple and the wife was rarely at the business and the husband had a very bad spending habit. He decided to spend his money on me and the current lot of employees were none too happy to see me on board, since after the initial honeymoon period I was to get on board as commission. I got out of that desperate situation as quickly as I could, but it was the worst month of my career."
16576,Prompt,Where is the worst place you have been stuck for a long time?
16577,General Response,I worst place that I have been stuck in for a long time was traffic in the nearest city. This was terrible because I could move the car of do anything to help the situation. I was completely helpless and it was wasting my time.
16578,Prompt,Where is the worst place you have been stuck for a long time?
16579,General Response,I was stuck on a military base where I didn't want to be. I was waiting a long time to be transferred to another base.
16580,Prompt,Where is the worst place you have been stuck for a long time?
16581,General Response,"Seriously, I was once stuck on a rural highway in West Virginia as night was coming. I had a flat tire. I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't been able to get assistance."
16582,Prompt,Where is the worst place you have been stuck for a long time?
16583,General Response,"The worst place where I have been stuck is on an airplane, the doors closed but sitting at the gate with a long and unexplained delay."
16584,Prompt,Do you think having your employees be afraid of how much they love you is a successful management approach?
16585,General Response,"No, I think that it is the worst approach, because they do not actually love you all if they are scared of you. In fact they probably loathe you."
16586,Prompt,Do you think having your employees be afraid of how much they love you is a successful management approach?
16587,General Response,I believe that is a successful management approach because anything is better than a fear-based leadership.
16588,Prompt,Do you think having your employees be afraid of how much they love you is a successful management approach?
16589,General Response,Having my employees fear me is not not a good approach because it will hinder their work performance.
16590,Prompt,Do you think having your employees be afraid of how much they love you is a successful management approach?
16591,General Response,This approach doesn't make any sense to me because employees will follow managers who they respect more than anything else
16592,Prompt,Do you think having your employees be afraid of how much they love you is a successful management approach?
16593,General Response,"I don't think employees should have love for you. They can like and respect you, but they should not love you. That would not be a successful management approach. That would be kind of strange."
16594,Prompt,"Which sci-fi invention does not exist yet, but you look forward to most?"
16595,General Response,"I look forward to having lifelike holograms to talk to and interact with for news and stories, possibly projected from a watch."
16596,Prompt,"Which sci-fi invention does not exist yet, but you look forward to most?"
16597,General Response,I really look forward to flying cars. Flying cars will allow people to get to newer locations much faster than current vehicles and law limits allow.
16598,Prompt,"Which sci-fi invention does not exist yet, but you look forward to most?"
16599,General Response,"Oh, my gosh!  Wouldn't it be great if we could teleport like on Star Trek?!  I've been intrigued by this idea since I was a kid.  I look forward to the day when we can be beamed from one location to another.  It would be such a time saver.  And, of course, totally ""green""."
16600,Prompt,"Which sci-fi invention does not exist yet, but you look forward to most?"
16601,General Response,I'd say time travel. There are just so many events that happened throughout history that should have never happened and I'd like to try to fix some of them.
16602,Prompt,"Which sci-fi invention does not exist yet, but you look forward to most?"
16603,General Response,I would love to be able to travel time or just look into the future. It would help me be more optimistic I think.
16604,Prompt,How often do you stay up past 3 a.m.?
16605,General Response,"I stay up past 3AM pretty often, especially when I don't have work or class early the next day. I enjoy being up late at night and the peace the night brings."
16606,Prompt,How often do you stay up past 3 a.m.?
16607,General Response,"Not as often as I used to, because of my changing schedule. But late night is my favorite part of the day. Or night."
16608,Prompt,How often do you stay up past 3 a.m.?
16609,General Response,"Every single night. I work at night, so I usually sleep during the day and stay up all night."
16610,Prompt,How often do you stay up past 3 a.m.?
16611,General Response,"I stay up past 3 a.m. all the time. I've always been a night owl. Even when I was a little kid, during the summers I would stay up all night. But, then again, I've never really needed much sleep. So, it isn't like I would sleep all day."
16612,Prompt,How often do you stay up past 3 a.m.?
16613,General Response,"I do not stay up past 3 am very often at all, I'm normally asleep by 1:30 am the latest every night."
16614,Prompt,What are your hobbies?
16615,General Response,"I like photography, coloring, crafts and painting. I like to walk on the beach and collect seaglass and spend time withmy puppy and fiance."

16617,General Response,"I love to read, anything and everything I can get my hands (or eyes) on! I also like to work on MTurk and go to concerts."
16618,Prompt,What are your hobbies?
16619,General Response,I like to read when I have time to relax and singing and dancing always makes you feel good too
16620,Prompt,What are your hobbies?
16621,General Response,My hobbies are playing computer games and watching videos and shows because it is more rewarding than doing anything else.
16622,Prompt,What are your hobbies?
16623,General Response,I like to go rollerblading at the park often. It's great exercise and really fun.

16625,General Response,"I have  over ten apps, and most of them are related to social media or entertainment"
16626,Prompt,How many apps do you have on your phone?
16627,General Response,"I have several apps. I have a ""Flo"" app to help us with conception. I have a podcast app that helps me organize my podcasts. I have a music app where I can view youtube videos. I got this app originally for music videos, but I actually watch discussions on youtube quite a bit from them and found some audiobooks too. I have one game app, which is my Sudoku game app. I have Instagram and Yelp. I think I have fewer than most, but I acquired quite a few in the past month alone, when I started traveling for the summer."
16628,Prompt,How many apps do you have on your phone?
16629,General Response,"I have about 6 apps. The list is facebook, hulu, amazon music, pandora, candy crush and yahtzee. I like to play games and watch show online."

16632,Prompt,How many apps do you have on your phone?
16633,General Response,"I have about ten apps on my phone.  Most of them are games, including all of the different versions of Candy Crush."
16634,Prompt,Would you rather go back in time and prevent the Titanic from sinking or prevent the 1929 stock market crash?
16635,General Response,I would rather prevent the 1929 stock market crash because I think it had a devastating impact on more people's lives.
16636,Prompt,Would you rather go back in time and prevent the Titanic from sinking or prevent the 1929 stock market crash?
16637,General Response,well id go back and prevent the stock market crash because the suffering was longer compared to the titanic
16638,Prompt,Would you rather go back in time and prevent the Titanic from sinking or prevent the 1929 stock market crash?
16639,General Response,"If I could go back in time I'd rather prevent the Titanic from sinking. There were families, small children and people on that boat having a good time. I'd rather they all lived."
16640,Prompt,Would you rather go back in time and prevent the Titanic from sinking or prevent the 1929 stock market crash?
16641,General Response,I would rather prevent the 1929 stock market crash because the crash affected everybody in the country and many around the world.
16642,Prompt,Would you rather go back in time and prevent the Titanic from sinking or prevent the 1929 stock market crash?
16643,General Response,The 1929 market crash I guess? I don't really know a lot about either but I do know the stock market crash significantly hurt a lot of people. The Titanic did too but not in the same way. The market crash had a lot more significantly lasting negative affects on people and changed the economy which also effects people who may not have been directly connected to it.
16644,Prompt,Would you rather be on an airplane between two arguing passengers or next to a screaming infant?
16645,General Response,I think I would rather be next to the infant being a mom myself that does not bother me and I could possibly help the mom or dad having the issue with calming the child. Being between to fighting people is annoying and could lead to me being dragged into it weither to give an opinion or getting hit.
16646,Prompt,Would you rather be on an airplane between two arguing passengers or next to a screaming infant?
16647,General Response,"The arguing passengers, obviously. Eventually they calm down. Babies do not like traveling for a long period of time and they let it be known throughout the flight."
16648,Prompt,Would you rather be on an airplane between two arguing passengers or next to a screaming infant?
16649,General Response,I would rather be next to a screaming infant. There is no reason to argue on a plane for hours. At least the baby is crying because that is a reasonable thing for an infant to do.
16650,Prompt,Would you rather be on an airplane between two arguing passengers or next to a screaming infant?
16651,General Response,"The screaming infant.  He'll probably shut up eventually, but idiots will argue forever.  And the kid doesn't know any better."
16652,Prompt,Would you rather be on an airplane between two arguing passengers or next to a screaming infant?
16653,General Response,"I'd definitely rather be between two arguing passengers on a plane. I can't stand crying babies on a plane. At least if two people are fighting, you get a front row seat to the drama. And maybe a funny story to tell people about later."
16654,Prompt,Would you rather always have a booger in your nose that moves when you breathe in and out or a piece of food stuck between your two front teeth?
16655,General Response,"If I had to choose between a booger that moves in and out when I breathe or s piece of food in between my two front teeth, I definitely choose the food between my teeth.  I would much rather not notice some minuscule piece of food then have to feel the booger flap on and out as I breathe!"
16656,Prompt,Would you rather always have a booger in your nose that moves when you breathe in and out or a piece of food stuck between your two front teeth?
16657,General Response,"I'll take the booger, I'd get used to it after a while. Food stuck in between your teeth can cause cavities!"
16658,Prompt,Would you rather always have a booger in your nose that moves when you breathe in and out or a piece of food stuck between your two front teeth?
16659,General Response,"I would rather have a booger in my nose, because boogers are helpful. But food would rot the teeth it was stuck to."
16660,Prompt,Would you rather always have a booger in your nose that moves when you breathe in and out or a piece of food stuck between your two front teeth?
16661,General Response,I would rather have a piece of food stuck between my teeth.  Having food stuck in your teeth is less awkward then having a booger play hide and seek every time you breathe through your nose.
16662,Prompt,Would you rather always have a booger in your nose that moves when you breathe in and out or a piece of food stuck between your two front teeth?
16663,General Response,"I would choose to have a piece of food stuck between my two front teeth. That way, I could simply never talk or smile and no one would know my embarrassing secret. If I had a booger in my nose that always moved when I breathed, everyone would know my disgusting secret."
16664,Prompt,Have your parents influenced what goals you have?
16665,General Response,"Of course, my parents wouldn't let me do anything unless my grades were up and they were always reading books, so that's why I am academic and I'm such a bookworm."
16666,Prompt,Have your parents influenced what goals you have?
16667,General Response,"My parents influenced past goals, like going to college. Now my mom just wants grand kids, and she is definitely pushing for that."
16668,Prompt,Have your parents influenced what goals you have?
16669,General Response,"yes my goals were nursing as I have a helpful nature, but my mother was also a nurse which was inspiring"
16670,Prompt,Have your parents influenced what goals you have?
16671,General Response,My dad wanted me to be a doctor but didn't influence me because I had a fear of blood and organs.
16672,Prompt,Have your parents influenced what goals you have?
16673,General Response,Yes they have as a matter of fact they encouraged me to stay in college when I so desparately wanted to quit.  They explained the importance of continuing with my education in hopes of getting into the field of study that I was interested in.  They also said it would make it easier to find a good job once I complete four years of college.
16674,Prompt,Favorite place to get fast food? Why?
16675,General Response,"My favorite fast food restaurant is canes! I love their three finger combo meal. It comes with 3 chicken strips,wavy fries, Garlic bread, lemonade or iced tea, and finally a delicious taste of cane's sauce."
16676,Prompt,Favorite place to get fast food? Why?
16677,General Response,"Chick-Fil-A  is my favorite fast food joint because I love their special sauces. I guess chicken is chicken but man, it's so good."
16678,Prompt,Favorite place to get fast food? Why?
16679,General Response,"Bojangles. They have the BEST chicken and sweet tea. My favorite thing to get from there is a chicken biscuit (literally just a piece of fried chicken on a buttery biscuit), their french fries with extra seasoning, dirty rice and a sweet tea. Nothing better than a Bojangles biscuit."
16680,Prompt,Favorite place to get fast food? Why?
16681,General Response,My favorite fast food restaurant is Arby's because they have good roast beef sandwiches and their sauce is wonderful.
16682,Prompt,Favorite place to get fast food? Why?
16683,General Response,"I prefer Sonic, which is a fast food drive-in. Their burgers are great and they have creative soda drinks."
16684,Prompt,"What would you do if you could do anything for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, assuming money were no object?"
16685,General Response,"I would sit in the lobby of the British Colonial Hotel in Nassau, Bahamas sipping on a cool tropical drink.  I've done that many times on my visits to the Bahamas.  Being in the Bahamas takes me to a warm, fuzzy place."
16686,Prompt,"What would you do if you could do anything for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, assuming money were no object?"
16687,General Response,I would sit and be with friends for eight hours a day. I really enjoy being with friends everyday and being with them everyday will be amazing. If I was with friends then we could travel and do new activities together.
16688,Prompt,"What would you do if you could do anything for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, assuming money were no object?"
16689,General Response,"I would play with my children, or home school my kids. I mean if money is no object I would try best to build a strong relationship with my kids."
16690,Prompt,"What would you do if you could do anything for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, assuming money were no object?"
16691,General Response,I would play at a casino on the slot machines.  It's thoughtless and so enjoyable!
16692,Prompt,"What would you do if you could do anything for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, assuming money were no object?"
16693,General Response,I would travel the world and see as much of it as possible and I would take a cruise around the world and sit there and watch the ocean all day.
16694,Prompt,What do you think of online education?
16695,General Response,"As a 61-year-old, I find the concept of online education fascinating.  except for a very short free on-line course I took a few years ago, I have no experience in it.  When I went to college in the mid to late 1970s, I could never imagine a person getting educated on-line.  I would have thought that would be something that wouldn't happen for, maybe, another century.  I think it's wonderful that people can organize their life around their education; take courses from the comfort of their own home.  However, and perhaps it's because of my age, I think there's something lacking in it...I think it's more interesting when people are in the same room exchanging ideas.  I know about chat rooms but it's not the same as being physically in the same place as others.  So I think online education is good, but certainly not ideal."
16696,Prompt,What do you think of online education?
16697,General Response,"I have taken multiple online classes, and I would not recommend them to people that are lazy."
16698,Prompt,What do you think of online education?
16699,General Response,I think it's a good alternative. With the ability to have classes away from a class it makes it more comfortable.
16700,Prompt,What do you think of online education?
16701,General Response,"I think online education is great for older people with busy lives. However, I think children benefit more from traditional schooling where they can learn social skills."
16702,Prompt,What do you think of online education?
16703,General Response,"Classroom is much better. Yet, I think online education can be resourceful for individuals who would like to continue education at home."
16704,Prompt,Would you rather suffer from spontaneous shouting or unpredictable fainting spells?
16705,General Response,I would rather shout spontaneously because I would be too prone to accidents if I fainted at random.
16706,Prompt,Would you rather suffer from spontaneous shouting or unpredictable fainting spells?
16707,General Response,"I would rather suffer from spontaneous shouting. Though embarrassing and sometimes rather inappropriate, unpredictable fainting spells could be very dangerous to myself and others."
16708,Prompt,Would you rather suffer from spontaneous shouting or unpredictable fainting spells?
16709,General Response,"I would rather suffer from unpredictable fainting spells. While it would be embarrassing and frightening, in comparison to spontaneous shouting, I feel like it would be better explainable in public."
16710,Prompt,Would you rather suffer from spontaneous shouting or unpredictable fainting spells?
16711,General Response,"If I had to choose between spontaneous shouting or unpredictably fainting, I think I'd choose shouting. I never have the guts to yell at anyone normally, so it would be exciting to just be able to scream in someone's face without control ... Unless I'm in a job interview. Then that wouldn't be so fun."
16712,Prompt,Would you rather suffer from spontaneous shouting or unpredictable fainting spells?
16713,General Response,"I would rather suffer from spontaneous shouting. Something severe could happen to me with the unpredictable fainting spells--I could pass out while driving (that's not good), for example. In an even worst scenario, someone could take advantage of me."
16714,Prompt,Which season are you most active in?
16715,General Response,"I'm most active in summer. My kids are out of school and we go to he beach, pool, bike rides. We don't have time constrictions and stay up late doing fun things."
16716,Prompt,Which season are you most active in?
16717,General Response,I'm most active in the winter because I love the cold. Keeps me from over heating.
16718,Prompt,Which season are you most active in?
16719,General Response,"Well obviously I am most active in the summer time. I have a boat that I like to drive really fast, if you know what I mean."
16720,Prompt,Which season are you most active in?
16721,General Response,"I'm most active in the summer. The Carolina heat and humidity don't bother me a bit, but cold weather in the winter turns me into a hermit."
16722,Prompt,Which season are you most active in?
16723,General Response,"Summer season is my most active season. It used to not be that way, but I love running outside and summer's in Washington offer the most rain-free days to get my run on. If I didn't have the younger kids, I'd probably say spring or fall, because of the cooler days, however right now it is summer time."
16724,Prompt,What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten from a fortune cookie?
16725,General Response,"The one that said ""A kiss can beautify souls, hearts and thoughts"" because I showed it to my wife and we have been kissing more often ever since."
16726,Prompt,What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten from a fortune cookie?
16727,General Response,It told me my lucky numbers. I played them and won like fifty dollars!
16728,Prompt,What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten from a fortune cookie?
16729,General Response,"To follow my dreams. Not that I really follow my dreams, but all in all it was a strong thought and something to think about."
16730,Prompt,What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten from a fortune cookie?
16731,General Response,"I opened a fortune cookie that said, ""Take a risk next week - it will pay off"" and I had forgotten about it until a friend mentioned a new job opportunity.  The pay, commune and benefits were much better than my current job but I wasn't sure I was qualified.  I ended up going through the interview process and getting the job!"
16732,Prompt,What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten from a fortune cookie?
16733,General Response,The best advice i have received from a fortune cookie was that fear is the only obstacle standing between me and success
16734,Prompt,Do you prefer to go off the beaten path when you travel?
16735,General Response,I usually stick to well-mapped areas when I travel. I get lost easily even with GPS and printed directions.
16736,Prompt,Do you prefer to go off the beaten path when you travel?
16737,General Response,"There is nothing more fun than experiencing things in an unknown place that the average public will not.  I like to travel off the beaten path, but not to the extent our lives will be in danger doing so."
16738,Prompt,Do you prefer to go off the beaten path when you travel?
16739,General Response,"I would only do that if I was familiar with the place I was traveling to. Ever watch the ID channel? I'm not too much of a risk taker and so if it's a new place, being safer with staying on the beaten path is my choice."
16740,Prompt,Do you prefer to go off the beaten path when you travel?
16741,General Response,I prefer to go off the beaten path because it often makes for a better story.
16742,Prompt,Do you prefer to go off the beaten path when you travel?
16743,General Response,I am far to scared about getting lost or kidnapped to go off the beaten path!
16744,Prompt,What is the biggest change you want to make in your life?

16746,Prompt,What is the biggest change you want to make in your life?
16747,General Response,"I want to lose weight and be healthier, as I get older my health is affecting my day to day life."
16748,Prompt,What is the biggest change you want to make in your life?
16749,General Response,I want to become debt free and move to the east coast.
16750,Prompt,What is the biggest change you want to make in your life?
16751,General Response,The biggest change i want to make in my life is waking up early because for most of my adult life i have been waking up very late.
16752,Prompt,What is the biggest change you want to make in your life?
16753,General Response,"I want to move to another country for a few years, to experience another culture and get perspective."
16754,Prompt,Do you prefer to watch or read the news?

16980,Prompt,"What is something you have always wanted, but could not have due to social stigmas?"
16981,General Response,"There are dark moments in my marriage where I wished that I had a child without needing a partner. Marriage is such a trial sometimes. It is not an easy endeavor. I think it is more detrimental to a person than parenthood. Being a parent has many more positives that outweigh the negatives, which are really just challenges that make you a better person. Marriage can really displace your person or set you up for failure. It can be very difficult to recover from."
16982,Prompt,"What is something you have always wanted, but could not have due to social stigmas?"
16983,General Response,"I always wanted a black friend. But, I never really had one. I have some online, but never a close black friend."

17024,Prompt,"Would you rather give a speech to the whole school, including teachers, for 30 minutes or work in the school cafeteria for a semester?"
17025,General Response,"I have no problem talking in front of others, and I tend to tell very embellished stories. However, I have to choose the school cafeteria on this one. Think of all the free food samples!"
17026,Prompt,"Would you rather give a speech to the whole school, including teachers, for 30 minutes or work in the school cafeteria for a semester?"

17034,Prompt,Would you rather be rich and alone or be poor and find true love?
17035,General Response,"I would rather be poor and find true love. Being poor is a situation I can overcome. I might not ever become rich, but I would have the things that really count in life: True love, caring, dedication, devotion, companionship. My husband and I would be able to find ways to survive financially. It might not be easy but it would be worth it. 

Being rich and alone would  be harder. You would begin to hate people because you would realize that people don't truly care for you, only what you can give them or do for them. 

There is a chance that being poor and having your true love wouldn't work out either. A lot of couples, who truly love each other, fight and break up over money issues. Lack of money to take care of one's loved ones can change a person's personality. How many horror stories have been on the news about a spouse that committed domestic violence, or even murder and it is said about that person that they used to be a wonderful person until losing their job or financial troubles began and they started drinking or doing drugs. 

Human beings need love and companionship. Now that is not to say I wouldn't prefer being Rich and having my True love together. We would be able to accomplish so much more in life and help others."

17042,Prompt,Would you rather be rich and alone or be poor and find true love?
17043,General Response,"I think poor, but it really depends on how poor. There's a lot of suffering that happens to people because of the lack of money."
17044,Prompt,I am genuinely interested. What is one song you will never skip on your playlist?

17062,Prompt,"Kale, super food or overrated lettuce?"

17102,Prompt,Would you rather have the power to make anyone fall in love with you or be able to read minds?
17103,General Response,"Read minds. All of the people I love, love me back (except my cats), so I don't need that power. I'd be able to know what my baby needs when he's upset, know where to pet my cats, know what's bugging my husband when he ""doesn't want to talk about it"", what to get my dad for Father's Day/his birthday/Christmas, and I'd be able to annoy people by repeating back what they're thinking in a mocking tone when they make me angry. I'm really petty..."

When people want there drama television there will always be outlets for this, but some of the best new shows over the past few years tend to resonate with the watcher on a deeper level. And this is going to continue in the future."
17192,Prompt,What will be the future of TV shows?
17193,General Response,"TV shows get dumber and dumber, so I wouldn't be surprised if they made a show about fidget spinner.s"

17210,Prompt,What is your favorite board game and why?

17216,Prompt,Would you rather win the Nobel Peace Prize or 5 million dollars?

17219,General Response,"I'll take 5 million dollars. People who win the Nobel Peace Prize are good people who work hard or have done something amazing. I just don't have that in me. I would be an honor, of course but the money would be nicer. I could do more with the money."

17225,General Response,"I grew up in New York City and I really enjoyed going into the alley, next to my apartment building, and playing stickball with a few friends.  Even though it was about half a century ago, I can still see myself taking a swing at a baseball and hoping I didn't hit the ball so hard that it broke a nearby window.  Actually no windows were ever broken, although one time, one of my friends hit the ball so far that as I recall, it went into an open window far away from the alley.  man did we run away fast after that happened."

17234,Prompt,Would you rather have bad breath and body odor the entire day or be completely naked?
17235,General Response,I would prefer the former. I would just avoid people and not interact with anyone in close quarters. Being totally naked is a lot harder to hide than smelling bad!
17236,Prompt,Would you rather have bad breath and body odor the entire day or be completely naked?

17245,General Response,"I would rather use a public toilet with a snake in it, because I could hurry and the snake would probably leave me alone."
17246,Prompt,Would you rather have to use a public toilet that is extremely dirty and dark or one that has a snake in it?
17247,General Response,That depends on the snake. If not poisonous I would choose the one with the snake. Maybe I could clean the toilet area before using it. I would take the dirty one if the snake is poisonous.
17248,Prompt,Would you rather have to use a public toilet that is extremely dirty and dark or one that has a snake in it?
17249,General Response,"I'd prefer to use a toilet that has a snake in it, providing that the snake wasn't venemous. Most snakes honestly are not particularly dangerous, but the chances of contracting something dangerous from a dirty toilet seems far more likely. That and the fact that if I could see the snake, I could stay away from it and alleviate any chance of being hurt by it."
17250,Prompt,Would you rather have to use a public toilet that is extremely dirty and dark or one that has a snake in it?
17251,General Response,"Realistically, I'd have to stay away from the snake. As disgusting as a dark and dirty toilet may be, I definitely don't want a snake biting me when I have my pants down!"
17252,Prompt,Would you rather have to use a public toilet that is extremely dirty and dark or one that has a snake in it?
17253,General Response,"I eat enough fiber; I don't need a snake to scare the crap out of me. Plus, I've been to some shady pubs before. Those bathrooms could have had a crocodile in them and I might not have noticed."
17254,Prompt,What do you think of buffets?
17255,General Response,"I'm not a big fan of buffets--I can't eat very much in one sitting, so it doesn't seem worth the extra cost."
17256,Prompt,What do you think of buffets?
17257,General Response,"I personally have no idea how buffets stay in business! I mean, every time I go into one of those restaurants there are people in there that act like they've never seen food before and have been told they'll never get the chance to eat again. They just mound their plates to the point of overflowing. I think buffets would probably make more money if they charged some sort of special valet service to roll guests who are too full back out to their cars."
17258,Prompt,What do you think of buffets?
17259,General Response,"I love to go to buffets because you are not limited to one dish on the menu. If you have a craving for different items, you can just select what you want for one single price. In the long run, I believe it is a better deal."
17260,Prompt,What do you think of buffets?
17261,General Response,"I think that buffets are great restaurants to go to if you have a family, or just like to eat and have a variety of foods for one price."
17262,Prompt,What do you think of buffets?

17276,Prompt,How can governments make education more efficient?
17277,General Response,"Im a teacher and there are many ways I think education can become more efficient. First they should cut out some holidays, change the school hours from 9-5 to accomodate parents and when there is no school for weather related issues have online courses or online assignments and teach via computer. They should take the business people out of the equation that make decisions on teaching and curriculum. These people have never been educators they are business people."

17279,General Response,They can do away with so much restriction on school stuff and remove religion from the places it shouldn't be.
17280,Prompt,How can governments make education more efficient?
17281,General Response,"I think if the government gave more money to education than wellfare, it would improve a lot. The education budget just keeps getting cut when we should be building it up. Our kids deserve the brightest, and most successful future they can possibly have, but are getting held back by a government that refuses to give up their own paychecks for a greater America."
17282,Prompt,How can governments make education more efficient?
17283,General Response,"By putting more funding into education. It would also be helpful of they would quit regulating the way things are taught and allow students to learn different methods that work for them. Example: I had a math problem that I didn't understand when I was in, I think 6th grade. My dad explained a different way to do it and I got it right away. I got the problems I used that method on wrong because I didn't use the method the teacher taught. I had all of the answers right and I showed my work, but I didn't use the same method as everyone else."
17284,Prompt,Would you rather be a chef or a server?
17285,General Response,I would rather be a chef than a server because as the chef you're creating something rather than just delivering it.

17287,General Response,"I would rather be a chef than a server because chef's get paid more, duh! Plus, if a server brought back a plate that a patron disliked, I could put on my fancy hat and stomp out into the dining room and throw a fit in a fancy French accent. ""You eat what I make or you don't eat!"" As my mother used to say."
17288,Prompt,Would you rather be a chef or a server?

17296,Prompt,When did you realize people had accepted you as an adult?
17297,General Response,"When they started treating me as an equal. I don't have a specific time, it varied with different people. Even though I'm paying my own bills, married, have a child, and own a house, I have an aunt that still treats me like a child."
17298,Prompt,When did you realize people had accepted you as an adult?
17299,General Response,"I realized people had accepted me as an adult when I was in a class for college and I was auditing it, and some students came up to me and started asking me questions, like I was a special lecturer or something."
17300,Prompt,When did you realize people had accepted you as an adult?
17301,General Response,"I realized people had accepted me as an adult when I stopped getting carded while buying alcohol. I practically have to force people to check my age. I keep getting the ""visual acceptance"" on my receipt which I think translates to ""she looks old""."
17302,Prompt,When did you realize people had accepted you as an adult?
17303,General Response,I realized that people had accepted me as an adult when they started giving me responsibilities like looking after the house and younger children

17310,Prompt,"If you had the opportunity to spend a year in another country, where would you go?"
17311,General Response,"I would travel to the Philippines. I want to go somewhere that is a completely different culture, but where English can still be understood in an emergency."
17312,Prompt,"If you had the opportunity to spend a year in another country, where would you go?"
17313,General Response,"I once visited Australia and I would love to spend a whole year there because Sydney is a gorgeous city and the countryside is amazing! I love to see the dingos, kangaroos and koalas in the wild!"
17314,Prompt,Would you rather live in an amusement park or a zoo?
17315,General Response,"I would rather live in a zoo. Animals make better friends than mechanical rides, and there's air conditioning!"

17322,Prompt,Would you rather live in an amusement park or a zoo?
17323,General Response,"I would rather live in an amusement park. There would be food and entertainment. I would not have to worry about being mauled by animals! Plus, it would definitely smell better at an amusement park and I love roller coasters!"

17336,Prompt,What are some strange beliefs that some people have?
17337,General Response,"I believe most religions are strange. The belief in a God in the sky somewhere that helps in some ways, but also provides so much strife and struggle in others. These omnipresent beings that we are supposed to trust and implore to, but have so much wisdom and causes so much distress. People also like to carry on the myths of Santa and Tooth Fairy, which are largely based on materialism and I am not sure what their message or morals at the end of the day could really teach."
17338,Prompt,What are some strange beliefs that some people have?
17339,General Response,"Did you know that some people believe that the only reason we have the technology we have now is because many years ago, space aliens visited earth and left some of their own technology behind?

17361,General Response,"How many different ways do you want to know?  There's the ease or piracy, the spread of music through sites like Pandora, Spotify, iTunes, Amazon, etc.  There is also the ways music can be made.  Look at Gorillaz, they're completely animated, people love them!"

17374,Prompt,Do you text more or call more? Why?
17375,General Response,"I usually text more. I've never been much of a fan of phone conversations. Perhaps it's due to the deluge of date rejections I experienced from junior high through high school. Either way, it's always been easier to express myself with the written word."

17388,Prompt,Describe your dream car/motorcycle and why you love it.
17389,General Response,"My current dream car is very different from my dreams from childhood. I have just become to sensible and it may be no fun in my old mothering age. I want a car with good clearance, but not one that requires an additional hop and step to get into. I want a three row seating, but also great load capacity. I currently have seating, but my husband says the load capacity is not where it should be. Highly deceptive and confusing if you ask me! I want something durable, but not too big. A boring car, but with a fun paint job like a bright green! That would be nice and no carpet. Just rubber me insides that way it is fully functional. Lovely leather seats though please, because there is nothing better than worn out leather seats!"
17390,Prompt,Describe your dream car/motorcycle and why you love it.
17391,General Response,"My dream car would be a late model Mini Cooper with all the options (except moonroof because that would be stupid when sunroof is an option.) Mini Coopers are so cool.

17392,Prompt,Describe your dream car/motorcycle and why you love it.

17404,Prompt,Do you like documentaries? Why / why not?
17405,General Response,Documentaries are great! I think what a lot of people don't get is that many filmmakers really put creative thinking into how they structure their documentaries. Often they are even more creative than narrative films since there is no need to stick to a main story line.
17406,Prompt,Do you like documentaries? Why / why not?

17414,Prompt,Would you rather be completely alone for 5 years or never alone for 5 years?
17415,General Response,"Is this a trick question? If I was never alone, how would I pee or shower or pick my nose? Those people who were with me 24/7 would have to become very tolerant and lower their standards on what a human being should be like. Wait. Completely alone? Does that mean no phone? That might be a deal breaker."

17424,Prompt,Would you rather not use your computer for a month or not eat junk food for a month?
17425,General Response,"Wow, talk about a no-win situation.  Either way and I'd lose.  but given the choice, I'd definitely give up junk food for a month for the simple reason that giving up for my computer for a month would be really, really hard for me.  I have become so reliant on the internet for so many things I do: taking part in fantasy sports leagues, checking sports stats, and of course doing these M-turk hits.  Not eating junk food for a month would be awful, but not nearly as awful as giving up my beloved computer for a month."
17426,Prompt,Would you rather not use your computer for a month or not eat junk food for a month?
17427,General Response,Definitely not eat junk food for a month. I couldn't live without my computer and I would be healthier without junk food.

17431,General Response,"Ok thanks an easy one. I would easily give up junk food. I need my computer for communication, work, and entertainment. Who knows, I might lose a few pounds, even though I am sitting on my ass in front of a computer all day. Now if I could just exercise once in awhile."
17432,Prompt,Would you rather not use your computer for a month or not eat junk food for a month?
17433,General Response,"Wow, I would have to choose not to eat junk food. Is that sad? I love junk food, but if I cut junk food out of my diet, I would lose weight and save money. I don't think I would get the same benefit from not using my computer."
17434,Prompt,Would you rather walk barefoot in a public bathroom or through poison ivy?
17435,General Response,"I'd rather go through the poison ivy, since at least I know what it is. Who knows what is on the floor of a public bathroom? I'm gagging just thinking about it."
17436,Prompt,Would you rather walk barefoot in a public bathroom or through poison ivy?
17437,General Response,I would rather walk through a public bathroom barefoot because later i can use antiseptic to wash off the germs

17440,Prompt,Would you rather walk barefoot in a public bathroom or through poison ivy?
17441,General Response,"I would rather walk through poison ivy. I have never gone through it, so the experience wouldn't be as bad, since it's the first time.

17446,Prompt,Would you rather have no sense of smell or smell everything around you with extra ability?
17447,General Response,I'd rather smell everything with extra ability. What would be the difference between extra ability and pregnant nose? I've been pregnant 3 times so I think I had the extra ability already. No big deal!

17462,Prompt,Would you rather be 42_ or 82_?

17516,Prompt,Would you rather have live one hundred years in the future or one hundred years in the past?
17517,General Response,"100 years in the past! No question, in some ways I am already trying to do so. We bought a piece of property last year and have started a farmstead. We are growing and raising our own food. We still use tech, but are trying to get back to a simpler way of life. It is the little things, that I love about it and make me want some more of the past. Nothing smells better then bread cooking in the oven, or laundry that has come fresh off the line. There is a sense of satisfaction that I don't get in my job that I do get from working our land. It's funny how some people react when I say we raise animals for food. People think it cruel, or gross, or too much work. Other think it is the most amazing thing ever!"

I probably might just do that instead.
17536,Prompt,Time freezes for everyone but you for one day. What do you do?
17537,General Response,When time freezes for everyone except me I sneak out onto football fields and create some modern art.
17538,Prompt,Time freezes for everyone but you for one day. What do you do?
17539,General Response,"If time froze and I could move, since that will never happen, I would do something I would never do. But, I would have to collect as much treasure as possible in that time frame, because I am poor, and it sucks."
17540,Prompt,Time freezes for everyone but you for one day. What do you do?
17541,General Response,I would travel the whole world and do things that I have never got to experience.

17550,Prompt,"If you could make a holiday, what would it be like? What traditions would it have? What would people eat on your holiday?"

17568,Prompt,Would you rather be a rabbit or a fox?

17592,Prompt,What is the hardest sport to excel at?
17593,General Response,Geez...that would have to boxing. I just think about having to block and move away from all those crazy punches that get thrown. The training has to be brutal.
17594,Prompt,Does technology simplify life or make it more complicated?
17595,General Response,"Technology makes life more complicated, because it never does the thing we want it to do in the efficiency we want it done at.

17602,Prompt,Does technology simplify life or make it more complicated?
17603,General Response,"It definitely does both, but overall it simplifies life.  It makes communication so much faster and convenient.  A person who has to make quick contact with someone can now achieve that.  in some ways it makes life more complicated because when technology breaks down, the results can be awful.  One example of this just happened to me in the last 2 weeks.  there was a computer break down at my local health clinic which resulted in a referral not being made to another health clinic.  I'm very upset about this; but that's another story.  But overall, it's simplified life in many ways."

17824,Prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
17825,General Response,"OMG! Are we talking a poisonous snake or a harmless one?  I'm not particularly scared of snakes in general so if it's nonpoisonous, then definitely I'd rather hold the snake. But if it's a poisonous snake, then I'll take the bee sting on the face. Better that than risk a snake bite from a poisonous snake."
17826,Prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
17827,General Response,I'd rather hold a snake because that's not painful and I am not scared of them.
17828,Prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
17829,General Response,"Seeing as I'm not allergic to bees, I would rather have a bee sting me on the face. Snakes are far more menacing to me."
17830,Prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
17831,General Response,"I would definitely hold a snake. I loved learning about snakes when I was kid, so they don't bother me at all."
17832,Prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
17833,General Response,"I would rather hold a snake, as long as it isn't poisonous.  If it is poisonous, then I would rather a bee sting me on the face.  If I could choose, I'd prefer to have the bee sting on my cheeks, away from my eyes and mouth."
17834,Prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
17835,General Response,"I'm not sure what defines a sport. I believe fishing is a sport because it's competitive but I'm not sure a sport needs to be competitive to be considered a sport. Fishing is more physical than most people would expect. Video game tournaments are definitely sporting events, people are competing with their skill, knowledge, strategy, and hand-eye coordination-- it may not be an easy concept for people who grew up on Pac-Man to accept but video games have all the elements of a sport."
17836,Prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
17837,General Response,"I think a sport should involve physical activity. I do not consider fishing or video game tournaments to be sports. They can still be worthwhile endeavors and competitions, but are just not sports in my mind."
17838,Prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
17839,General Response,A sport is any activity that is played a certain way with a certain set of rules and can have a competitive nature. Fishing and video game tournaments can definitely be considered a sport because they fall into this category.
17840,Prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
17841,General Response,A sport is where physical activity comes into play. Fishing and a Video Game Tournament is not a sport because there is not a lot of physical activity occurring in both these sports
17842,Prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
17843,General Response,"To me, physical exertion defines the word ""sport"". I would consider fishing to be a sport, however, I would consider video game tournaments to be a hobby."
17844,Prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
17845,General Response,A submarine! I'd explore the ocean and be home in time for dinner. Can't do that with a space ship.
17846,Prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
17847,General Response,"I'd rather have a submarine because most of the sea remains unexplored, and a space shuttle is not designed for deep space exploration."
17848,Prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
17849,General Response,I would rather have a submarine. I love the water. Im not a fan of heights. I think i would like the view alot better below then on top
17850,Prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
17851,General Response,"I would rather a space shuttle as they are more rare and costlier to make, I believe."
17852,Prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
17853,General Response,"I would rather have a submarine because I still want to stay on Earth.  Although the idea of being so deep under water is frightening, being in outer space is even more scary to me."
17854,Prompt,Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?
17855,General Response,Better to live where there are four seasons. Fashion always changes. Just prefer the change.
17856,Prompt,Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?
17857,General Response,It is better to live where there are four seasons because there is more variety and it is harder to become tired of just one season.
17858,Prompt,Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?
17859,General Response,I like that the seasons change so I would prefer to live those places
17860,Prompt,Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?
17861,General Response,"Okay, everybody knows that I hate cold weather with a passion. And I live in NC, so we get four seasons, even though I know our winters aren't as cold as other parts of the US...but if I could, I'd live in southwest Florida...I don't need four seasons!"
17862,Prompt,Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?
17863,General Response,"I think its good to have 4 seasons for the good of the environment, it brings change."
17864,Prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
17865,General Response,I would bring back Breaking Bad. That show was so suspenseful and I became very attached to the characters!
17866,Prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
17867,General Response,"If I could bring back any TV show that was cancelled, it would have to be 2 Broke Girls. That show was so bad that I'd bring it back just to see it canceled again."
17868,Prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
17869,General Response,"This is going to sound crazy that I'm still upset over them canceling Dracula with Jonathan Rhys Meyers but, come on! It made no sense. They only gave it two seasons and when they announced they were canceling it, the fans went ballistic. So, yeah... if I could bring back one show that was canceled, I'd definitely bring back Dracula with the original cast."
17870,Prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
17871,General Response,I would ask to bring back sleepy hollow. I loved that show and how they brought in icabod crane. I thought it was really interesting.
17872,Prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
17873,General Response,I would bring back Futurama--I enjoyed watching that show a lot and would like to see more misadventures with the characters.
17874,Prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
17875,General Response,The worst fast food place happens to be Hardee's. Hardee's has the soggiest french fries coupled with extremely greasy burgers and sandwiches. I've tried to give them second chances but they always seem to fail. Even their milkshakes fall short of being tasty. The food and drinks taste bland and boring time after time.
17876,Prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
17877,General Response,All of them? How do you pick one out of many that will damage your health? But as far as taste goes I think it would be Arby's. If you are going to  eat unhealthy food make it count.
17878,Prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
17879,General Response,"Jack in the Box is terrible, it's by far the worst fast food restaurant chain. I think though the worst fast food restaurant is a little Teriyaki place in Woodland, WA. The people are wonderful and I feel bad saying they're the worst, but nothing I've ordered there even resembles what it's supposed to be, it's pretty awful. Did I mention the people are wonderful? They are-- just order a soda or iced tea, because they really are very nice. Or pick up food there for your enemies.I'm a bad person."
17880,Prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
17881,General Response,"Krystal's is the absolute worst fast food restaurant. The famous Krystal burgers are not filling, they're bland, and they have a weird texture to the meat."
17882,Prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
17883,General Response,I honestly can't stand eating at hardees. All there food taste like old grease.
17884,Prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
17885,General Response,"Can't say that I do either, but I guess scratching my privates.  Itches happen...there is nothing other than pure nastiness that leads to someone, especially an adult, eating boogers!"
17886,Prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
17887,General Response,"Scratching my privates I suppose, worst comment that could happen there is something along the lines of ""Typical man"""
17888,Prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
17889,General Response,"I would rather get caught eating a booger. It's better to be judged as someone who ""just needed a little salt,"" versus, being judged as someone who might have a case of raging crabs in their private parts and spreading it to others if they don't wash their hands."
17890,Prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
17891,General Response,well theyre both disgusting but eating a booger is far worse than getting caught scratching your private
17892,Prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
17893,General Response,"Ewwww, for real!? I would rather get caught scratching my privates. Eating a booger would just be gross. I almost want to gag thinking about it!"
17894,Prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
17895,General Response,I think they are useful and are needed.  There has to be someway to measure student's knowledge and teaching success.  But I do believe that this should never be the only measure used.  These test results need to be used in conjunction with other measures.
17896,Prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
17897,General Response,"Standardize test are not beneficial to student. Lesson and locations of student differ greatly across countries, especially large countries. Since students are taught differently, they are not equally tested on their intellectual ability."
17898,Prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
17899,General Response,"I don't think that they're really useful at all. They are not only too easy, but also a waste of time because that's all you get taught."
17900,Prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
17901,General Response,Standardized tests are unfair to the students since the individuals do not get a chance to showcase their best talents
17902,Prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
17903,General Response,"I think standarized tests are terrible as a teacher and they do not measure what students know. The teachers are only allowed to teach to the test to get high scores for the district so they can receive money and be compared to other districts. These tests do not take into account upbringing, home life, students personal struggles, mental health issues, the lack of funding in their school districts, parental life."
17904,Prompt,What are your goals for the next two years?
17905,General Response,To learn as much as I can and prepare well for my future. The learning never stops though.

17909,General Response,I would like to conceive at least one to two more children. It would complete our family circle. My children want siblings and they are such lovely people. I believe they deserve the best chance of happiness. Our small family dynamic makes their future a little precarious. Having a few more links to their line would strengthen their future options. We are always on the course of lowering our debt. So there is always that.
17910,Prompt,What are your goals for the next two years?
17911,General Response,"My goal is to attain a new job, grow our landscaping business and customer base and be able to purchase a new car and better home."
17912,Prompt,What are your goals for the next two years?
17913,General Response,My goals are to get some repairs done on the inside and outside of my home. I have to do them little by little due to my financial constraints.

17916,Prompt,Do you like going to concerts? Why or why not? What was the last concert you went to?
17917,General Response,"I love going to concerts!  It's even better now that there's almost always a meet and greet after the show and you can meet the band!  The last show I saw was either Gaelic Storm or Breaking Benjamin.  I saw both of them in the last year, both were AMAZING!  I got to meet both bands, get autographs, and I can't wait to see them again!"
17918,Prompt,Do you like going to concerts? Why or why not? What was the last concert you went to?

I can't recall the name of the concert, it was in my tween years, but it was like a christian version of Lollapalooza, ya know?"
17922,Prompt,Do you like going to concerts? Why or why not? What was the last concert you went to?
17923,General Response,"I like going to concerts because it is a very social experience. The last concert I went to was with my nephew, and we went and saw the band Great Big Sea."
17924,Prompt,What is the most overrated movie?

17929,General Response,"The most overrated movie, to me, is Bat Man. I hate super hero movies and they drag on and on forever."
17930,Prompt,What is the most overrated movie?
17931,General Response,The most overrated movie is James Cameron's Avatar. It was a very bland story that tried to hide behind pretty visuals to pick up the slack.
17932,Prompt,What is the most overrated movie?
17933,General Response,"In my opinion, Forrest Gump is the most overrated. I think the Forrest Gump joke is funny though; where he's standing at the Pearly Gates in Heaven!"

17935,General Response,"My favorite novel is ""Watson's Go to Birmingham."" It is an excellent book and has always held my attention."

17938,Prompt,What is your favorite novel?
17939,General Response,My favorite novel would have to be Atlas Shrugged. I've read it a bunch. It's definitely at the top of my list.
17940,Prompt,What is your favorite novel?
17941,General Response,"My most favorite novel would be Little Women. It was a story that I immersed myself at an early age and impressed me with the feminine spunk. The girl did not always have to pair off with the boy. Life was unexpected, but full of charm and joy."
17942,Prompt,What is your favorite novel?
17943,General Response,"My favorite novel is Exodus by Leon Uris.  Uris immerses the reader in the lives, places, culture, and history of his novels to the point that the reader feels they have lived the story."
17944,Prompt,Would you rather save your country from an invasion or from a terrible disease?
17945,General Response,I would rather save it from a terrible disease. Germs can spread fast and are hard to control...but we have a great military to fight an invasion.
17946,Prompt,Would you rather save your country from an invasion or from a terrible disease?
17947,General Response,"I would rather save my country from a terrible disease, because when someone is stricken by a disease there is no face. If it is your loved one that is stricken and you need to quarantine and understand what is going on. The human nature in all of us and knowledge and there is so much in diseases, so much in nature that we may never know that terrifies us. The threat from another country is much easier to combat. I believe the hysteria and the unknown is something that we can manage."
17948,Prompt,Would you rather save your country from an invasion or from a terrible disease?
17949,General Response,I would rather save the country from and invasion than from a terrible disease. The reason i chose invasion is because i at least know i am fighting something i can seen and i have a chance.
17950,Prompt,Would you rather save your country from an invasion or from a terrible disease?
17951,General Response,I would rather save my country from a terrible disease because it wouldn't involve violence to do so.
17952,Prompt,Would you rather save your country from an invasion or from a terrible disease?
17953,General Response,I would save my country from disease. It would be easier to save them from a disease because that's more proactive and preventative than an invasion.

17958,Prompt,Would you rather go to your 20-year class reunion and nobody remember who you are or have everybody comment on how old you look?

17960,Prompt,Would you rather go to your 20-year class reunion and nobody remember who you are or have everybody comment on how old you look?
17961,General Response,I would rather be forgotten than told that i am old because then i would feel that all the effort i have put into making myself stay young was for nothing.
17962,Prompt,Would you rather go to your 20-year class reunion and nobody remember who you are or have everybody comment on how old you look?
17963,General Response,I would rather go to a 20 year class reunion and have no one remember who I was because I probably would not remember half of them anyway.
17964,Prompt,Would you rather stand all day at work or sit all day at work?
17965,General Response,"I already sit all day at work and at the end of the day I'm always craving a good walk. So I'd say I'd rather stand, but I also remember working in retail where I had to stand all day and couldn't wait to sit. I guess a mixture would be best."
17966,Prompt,Would you rather stand all day at work or sit all day at work?
17967,General Response,"I would rather stand all day. Sitting is boring and I like to move around. Standing all day is habit. I have small children that always had to be moving and as soon as I'd sit down, they would wake up."
17968,Prompt,Would you rather stand all day at work or sit all day at work?
17969,General Response,"I would rather stand all day at work, even though I couldn't do that right now. An injury is keeping me dormant, and it's driving me crazy!"
17970,Prompt,Would you rather stand all day at work or sit all day at work?
17971,General Response,"Standing is probably way better for you, you get to work on your posture, and be more active. But the thought of standing all day sounds so exhausting, so I think I'd rather sit down. Standing would just make work even less enjoyable."
17972,Prompt,Would you rather stand all day at work or sit all day at work?
17973,General Response,Sit Down! I'm about as in shape as a fat pug.

17988,Prompt,If you were a superhero would you want to also have a sidekick?
17989,General Response,"If I was a superhero I would not want to have a sidekick, because this means that you would have to always be looking out for someone else and make sure they are safe. I prefer to always work alone."

17991,General Response,I would not want a sidekick if I were a superhero because I wouldn't want them to influence me too much.
17992,Prompt,If you were a superhero would you want to also have a sidekick?
17993,General Response,I would love if my brother could be my sidekick--I don't think anyone can do what a superhero has to do without support.
17994,Prompt,What is the first thing you do after you win the lotto?
17995,General Response,"The first thing I would do is celebrate winning the lottery.  Jump up and down, probably scream with surprise and hug my husband.  Then I would quickly figure out where we needed to go to collect the money."

18006,Prompt,Which sport is the most exciting to watch? Which is the most boring to watch?
18007,General Response,I love to watch football.  The players seem like gladiators and they are so big and strong.  The game is so exciting.  The most boring to me is golf.

18008,Prompt,Which sport is the most exciting to watch? Which is the most boring to watch?
18009,General Response,Baseball is the most exciting and golf or tennis is the most boring to watch. But tennis is fun to watch in person.

18013,General Response,"Soccer is the most exciting sport to watch, players are always on the move, the competition and fast paced game is definitely worth a watch!

18014,Prompt,Do you like social media? Why or why not?
18015,General Response,"I love social media, it makes it so I can connect with people. I live in an urban area and it's hard to really get to know people. Having social media allows me to get to know somebody over a longer period of time, and build that inherent trust."
18016,Prompt,Do you like social media? Why or why not?
18017,General Response,I like social media because it is a great way of connecting with people around the world as well as learning new things and trends
18018,Prompt,Do you like social media? Why or why not?
18019,General Response,Social media is a double edged sword. I like it because it allows me to easily stay connected with my friends and family who live far away. They can stay updated on my children and watch them grow up via Instagram and Facebook. I don't like social media because I believe it can become addicting and be a source of distraction in our day to day lives.
18020,Prompt,Do you like social media? Why or why not?
18021,General Response,"I constantly use social media, but I think it is a double-edged sword.  I think it can be a great way of staying connected with family and friends, and even meeting new people.  However, I think it can also facilitate a lot of unnecessary interpersonal drama between people in real life."
18022,Prompt,Do you like social media? Why or why not?
18023,General Response,"I like social media because it lets me contact my close friends and families, allows you to organise get togethers."
18024,Prompt,Have you ever spoke in front of a large group of people? How did it go?
18025,General Response,"I have spoken in front of a class containing about thirty people. The setting wasn't formal, and I had friends in the class, so everything went pretty well."
18026,Prompt,Have you ever spoke in front of a large group of people? How did it go?
18027,General Response,"yes, in high school. I have horrible stage fright but I am still alive so probably not as bad as I thought."
18028,Prompt,Have you ever spoke in front of a large group of people? How did it go?
18029,General Response,"Actually I did. I was really nervous at first before I got up there. I remember that once I started, it got way easier. Looking back it was like I blurred out the audience, which was around 500 people.

I would not want to be the captain of a sports team because I would be held as a figure to look up to and would have the authority over team mates. I am not the type of person that does well with power. It would go to my head.

18469,General Response,"The most annoying app I've tried would probably be Flappy Bird. Not because it was bad, but it was frustrating that it took so long to get the hang of it."
18470,Prompt,What is the most annoying app you have tried?
18471,General Response,I had a coupon app at one point and it was really annoying because it didn't work properly at all.
18472,Prompt,What is the most annoying app you have tried?
18473,General Response,"Snapchat. Not really a fan of it, I don't like taking pictures of myself and I was pestered to try it by a friend of mine."
18474,Prompt,Would you rather have only two close friends or many acquaintances?
18475,General Response,"I would rather have two close friends. Acquaintances come and go, but if you have a few close friends, they will last a lifetime."
18476,Prompt,Would you rather have only two close friends or many acquaintances?
18477,General Response,"I would rather have many acquaintances.  I believe that through my daily conversations I learn a lot of things from other people (and teach them also).  The more, the merrier!  And the more well-rounded we will be!"
18478,Prompt,Would you rather have only two close friends or many acquaintances?
18479,General Response,I rather have only two close friends because you can't really depend on acquaintances to care about you or help you.
18480,Prompt,Would you rather have only two close friends or many acquaintances?
18481,General Response,"I would only like to have two close friends, since I already have my family. I don't see why people would want to have a lot of filler people in their lives."
18482,Prompt,Would you rather have only two close friends or many acquaintances?
18483,General Response,"I would much prefer two close friends over many acquaintances. I need someone I can trust, and whom I feel comfortable around, in order to talk about deep things that are going on in my life. I also enjoy being there for my close friends. Acquaintances are all fine and dandy, but there have been more moments than not, when I needed my best friend by my side."
18484,Prompt,Would you rather be the most intelligent kid in school and make awesome grades or be the most popular kid in school and make poor grades?
18485,General Response,I would rather be the most intelligent kid in school rather than the most popular kid in school who makes poor grades because I was actually a smart kid and I liked getting good grades.
18486,Prompt,Would you rather be the most intelligent kid in school and make awesome grades or be the most popular kid in school and make poor grades?
18487,General Response,"I would much rather be the most intelligent kid in school and make awesome grades. Awesome grades and intelligence will help me get into a great college, and then after I graduate, I will be able to get an awesome job. Popularity in school doesn't mean anything once you graduate, but intelligence can set you up for life!"
18488,Prompt,Would you rather be the most intelligent kid in school and make awesome grades or be the most popular kid in school and make poor grades?
18489,General Response,"I would rather be the most intelligent kid in school and make awesome grades, because that's what'll help me in the long run. After school, when I'm trying to get into college or get a career, it's those great grades that are going to help me to have a fulfilling and sustainable future."
18490,Prompt,Would you rather be the most intelligent kid in school and make awesome grades or be the most popular kid in school and make poor grades?
18491,General Response,"that's a tough call.  I think I'd rather be the most intelligent kid in school with great grades because in the long run it would be to my advantage.  I'm sure I'd still have a few good friends even though I wouldn't be extremely popular.  And being so intelligent would be great for my self-esteem.  It would open up great career opportunities.  being very popular would be nice, but getting poor grades would be very damaging in the long run."
18492,Prompt,Would you rather be the most intelligent kid in school and make awesome grades or be the most popular kid in school and make poor grades?
18493,General Response,"The most intelligent kid in school. That kid will have the better overall life and will go to a better college and have a better job. Popularity doesn't last long, as most people know."
18494,Prompt,"What would be more useful, being able to fly or breathe under water?"

18496,Prompt,"What would be more useful, being able to fly or breathe under water?"

18498,Prompt,"What would be more useful, being able to fly or breathe under water?"
18499,General Response,To be able to fly so you can see all of your surroundings.  If you were under water your peripheral views are limited and you could be attacked from behind.
18500,Prompt,"What would be more useful, being able to fly or breathe under water?"
18501,General Response,Being able to fly. I wouldn't have to sit in traffic and I could get places faster. Have you ever tried to swim quickly? Its not as easy as it seems plus you'd be soaking wet!
18502,Prompt,"What would be more useful, being able to fly or breathe under water?"
18503,General Response,"I'd definitely want to fly. It would be so much more thrilling to fly. You could save money on those drone photos, beat all the traffic, why bother paying for amusement park rides if you can just fly yourself now."
18504,Prompt,What is something you hate but you wished you loved?
18505,General Response,"I hate exercising, but wish I loved it.  I really need to exercise, but due to laziness and a foot injury, I find it really challenging."
18506,Prompt,What is something you hate but you wished you loved?
18507,General Response,I wished I loved anchovies on my pizza. All my friends love them and it forces me to buy a separate pizza for myself.
18508,Prompt,What is something you hate but you wished you loved?
18509,General Response,"Licorice. I see it everywhere and I want to eat it, especially those little licorice candies that look like cakes. I thought they'd taste like cake when I was little, but boy was I surprised!"
18510,Prompt,What is something you hate but you wished you loved?
18511,General Response,I really hate socializing but at times i wish i lived it especially when i'm feeling lonely.
18512,Prompt,What is something you hate but you wished you loved?
18513,General Response,"I hate truffles, but I wish I loved them. I hear that truffles are amazing and truffle fries are the best, but I have tried it and I find out unimpressive. I wish I liked truffles. I want to like them at least but I find them gross (and I am not a picky eater!)"
18514,Prompt,Would you rather be able to dress in designer clothes or buy everything you want at a discount store?
18515,General Response,Designer clothes can be fun and glamorous but I don't know where I'd wear them. But discount store items can be pretty boring and all look alike. I kind of like  a little shock value. I want to wear something amazing  I'd be murdered in it.
18516,Prompt,Would you rather be able to dress in designer clothes or buy everything you want at a discount store?
18517,General Response,Everything I want at a discount store.  I am not the type of person that is too flashy nowadays I am more practical.
18518,Prompt,Would you rather be able to dress in designer clothes or buy everything you want at a discount store?
18519,General Response,I'd rather buy everything I want at a discount store. I'd have a wider variety of clothes that I like and I'd have lots of extra money to spend on more important things.
18520,Prompt,Would you rather be able to dress in designer clothes or buy everything you want at a discount store?
18521,General Response,I would choose discount store as I always shop at second hand stores and thrift stores. It is better value for your money and you can find designer clothes in a thrift store for half the price or more.
18522,Prompt,Would you rather be able to dress in designer clothes or buy everything you want at a discount store?
18523,General Response,I'd rather buy everything I want at a discount store. I don't even know what is popular among designer clothes and you are only wearing it a few times before it is out of style and you are shopping for new clothes again.
18524,Prompt,Would you rather spend every minute the rest of your life outside or inside?
18525,General Response,"I would easily choose to spend the rest of my life inside. T.V., internet, video games, books, and family is all I need in the World. All of which are inside making going outside unnecessary."
18526,Prompt,Would you rather spend every minute the rest of your life outside or inside?
18527,General Response,"I would rather spend every minute inside because nature is merciless, and I can have some climate control while indoors."
18528,Prompt,Would you rather spend every minute the rest of your life outside or inside?
18529,General Response,I would prefer to spend every minute for the rest of my life outside where there is fresh air and so much to explore. Being stuck inside limits what you can do and who you can meet.
18530,Prompt,Would you rather spend every minute the rest of your life outside or inside?
18531,General Response,"I would rather spend every minute of the rest of my life inside. As long as I can still see out a window, I am happy. I am not too fond of the outdoors. Bugs and the elements tend to keep me away."
18532,Prompt,Would you rather spend every minute the rest of your life outside or inside?
18533,General Response,Did the cave men look happy? I didn't think so.
18534,Prompt,What is your most interesting hobby?
18535,General Response,"I love taking photos everywhere and anywhere of anything from a bush, a bird, to scenic vistas. I love how the camera captures the moment."
18536,Prompt,What is your most interesting hobby?
18537,General Response,That would have to be fishing. I never know if I'm going to go and catch something or stand there for four hours without a bite. It's always interesting to me how fish decide if they wanna bite the hook or not.
18538,Prompt,What is your most interesting hobby?
18539,General Response,I go to garage sales and estate sales and collect old typewriters and fountain pens because they provide such a contrast with the way we communicate now.
18540,Prompt,What is your most interesting hobby?
18541,General Response,"My most interesting hobby is crocheting.  I actually taught myself from a book years ago.  These days, I can learn new stitches on YouTube."
18542,Prompt,What is your most interesting hobby?
18543,General Response,My most interesting hobby is collecting and building Warhammer 40k action figurines.
18544,Prompt,Would you rather lose your keys (all of them: house and car) or lose your phone?
18545,General Response,"Oh boy, I can't live without my phone. I mean, I have all my contacts, my credit cards, my online profiles. I would much rather lose my keys. I can break a window and get into my apartment, but I can't replace all the photos and memories that I have in my phone. Plus, I could totally Tweet and Snapchat myself trying to break back into my house after losing my keys. I bet it would get a lot of hits."
18546,Prompt,Would you rather lose your keys (all of them: house and car) or lose your phone?
18547,General Response,"I would much rather lose my keys as opposed to my phone! I am a supervisor for a very large company and all of my employees phone numbers, along with addresses are in my phone. My keys can be replaced easily but it would take a very long time to replace the information in my phone."
18548,Prompt,Would you rather lose your keys (all of them: house and car) or lose your phone?
18549,General Response,"I would rather lose my phone. Of course, I'm old so I could just use my keys that I didn't lose to drive home and unlock my front door to get inside the house to use my house phone. Yes, I still have a landline."
18550,Prompt,Would you rather lose your keys (all of them: house and car) or lose your phone?
18551,General Response,"Good riddance to the useless phone, lose that, I need the keys to get into my house."
18552,Prompt,Would you rather lose your keys (all of them: house and car) or lose your phone?
18553,General Response,"That's easy, I'd rather lose my phone because I can always call the lockmaker to have new keys made but if I have my keys I can't really do anything with them."
18554,Prompt,When was the last time you went to a movie theater?
18555,General Response,Last time was about two weeks ago when i went to watch the Wonder Woman movie.
18556,Prompt,When was the last time you went to a movie theater?

18558,Prompt,When was the last time you went to a movie theater?
18559,General Response,The last time that I went to a movie theater was probably two years ago. It seems like since Hulu and Netflix and even HBO Now are available there is really not a need to go to a movie theater to get entertainment. I already have monthly subscriptions to watching things on screen.
18560,Prompt,When was the last time you went to a movie theater?
18561,General Response,"I go to the movie theater at least two or three times a month. I'm addicted to movies. And, hey, even if we don't see a movie while we're there, the theater near my house has got a great cafe and place to meet my friends."
18562,Prompt,When was the last time you went to a movie theater?
18563,General Response,"It's actually been a little while. It was my girlfriend's birthday, which coincided with Earth Day this year. Every year, they release a movie made for Earth Day, and she is a huge fan of them. They're essentially long Planet Earth episodes that focus in on a family of monkeys, bears, or some other cute critter. This year, the film was called Born in China and was a decent film that combined cuteness with emotion. She enjoyed it and I was glad she did!"
18564,Prompt,What was the last song you listened to?

18566,Prompt,What was the last song you listened to?
18567,General Response,"Rollin by Calvin Harris and Khaliid. It is such a good song! It has a really catchy chorus and the beat is upbeat and easy to listen to. It is such a great carefree summer song and the first time I heard it, I literally replayed it like 100 times. It just gets my body moving and distracts me from stupid life things for 3 minutes."
18568,Prompt,What was the last song you listened to?
18569,General Response,"Crazy Train' Ozzy Osbourne, but the remastered redone version, but I think it's post Randy Rhodes he makes that song its not the same."
18570,Prompt,What was the last song you listened to?
18571,General Response,"My daughter was dancing around to Uptown Funk by Bruno Mars before bed, so that's the last one I heard. But the last one I listened to on purpose was Crocodile Rock by Elton John."
18572,Prompt,What was the last song you listened to?
18573,General Response,"Well, I think the last song I listened to was Rock Me Like a Hurricane, because I was at a Canes Hockey game!"
18574,Prompt,What was your turning point to a more active life?
18575,General Response,"Honestly, I got more active when I got out of a boring relationship. I started working out and hanging out with my friends more. I definitely became more active instead of being sad it was over."
18576,Prompt,What was your turning point to a more active life?
18577,General Response,"My turning point to a more active life really began after I had children. I realized that I couldn't just sit on the couch and do nothing anymore, and that they really needed me to be more active with them around the house and outside."
18578,Prompt,What was your turning point to a more active life?
18579,General Response,When I got married and would rather go for a run than be home.
18580,Prompt,What was your turning point to a more active life?
18581,General Response,"During college I never had time to go outside and be active. I was always stuck in sitting down in front of my laptop, working. I started to get really restless legs which made it so difficult for me to fall asleep at night. I also would always have a really sore neck and back from hunching over my laptop all day. It started to get really hard for me to sit at my laptop for long periods, and I realized I needed to do something. I decided to take up running just a couple times a week and it helped me so much with my restless legs and my posture."
18582,Prompt,What was your turning point to a more active life?
18583,General Response,"I was getting ready to join the military and I realized I had never been physically active in my life. If I could get out of gym class in school, I did. So I printed out the minimum requirements to pass the physical exam in the military and worked towards it every day."
18584,Prompt,How fast do you read?
18585,General Response,I'm actually quite a fast reader due to years of studying for my liberal arts degree. I think the fastest I've ever read was the 6th Harry Potter book in only three days!
18586,Prompt,How fast do you read?
18587,General Response,"I don't know the specific number of words.  I read fast though, and more importantly, I can comprehend and recall what I read."

18589,General Response,I read moderately fast but I like to replace useless extraneous information with appropriate simpler terms in my head as I go along.
18590,Prompt,How fast do you read?
18591,General Response,I read quickly and I am a good skimmer. As a teacher this is a good skill to have.
18592,Prompt,How fast do you read?
18593,General Response,"I try to absorb two books per week. Obviously it depends on the size of the book, considering I can breeze through Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle in a couple days yet spend most of that particular week delving through Stephen King's It. I'll never try to read more than two at a time though, but not for the most obvious reasons; I use a King of Hearts as a bookmark - and I only possess two of them. Maybe some day I'll buy myself another pack of cards to read a third book, but I'm content for now."
18594,Prompt,Would you rather have all of your emails for the next two months made public or have your text messages read by everyone?
18595,General Response,Definitely my emails! The only ones I receive have to do with work or are random updates on my Amazon shipments. My text messages are definitely much more personal!

18602,Prompt,Would you rather have all of your emails for the next two months made public or have your text messages read by everyone?
18603,General Response,My emails are so boring. Let everyone have at them. My text messages are a little more personal. Would you like my email password? Go for it!

18608,Prompt,Would you rather surf in shark-infested waters or jump free fall with a parachute into the Grand Canyon?
18609,General Response,Free fall jump into the grand canyon because it's beautiful there. Plus I'd rather fall to my death than to be eaten by a shark if the worst situation occurred.
18610,Prompt,Would you rather surf in shark-infested waters or jump free fall with a parachute into the Grand Canyon?
18611,General Response,"Oh, I would definitely skydive into that Grand Canyon. I would do that normally."
18612,Prompt,Would you rather surf in shark-infested waters or jump free fall with a parachute into the Grand Canyon?
18613,General Response,"Do I have to pick on this one? They are both terrible ideas! I guess I'd take my chances with the Grand Canyon. After all, if I'm going to die, I'd rather have my last view be beautiful scenery as opposed to Jaws."
18614,Prompt,Would you rather have an arranged marriage or spend the rest of your life single?
18615,General Response,I would rather spend the rest of my life single because if you don't really love or like the person you marry you're life will be miserable.
18616,Prompt,Would you rather have an arranged marriage or spend the rest of your life single?
18617,General Response,Wow that is a tough question. I suppose I would rather be single for the rest of my life.
18618,Prompt,Would you rather have an arranged marriage or spend the rest of your life single?
18619,General Response,I would rather spend the rest of my life single instead of taking a chance and marrying someone I did not want to marry.

18621,General Response,I would rather spend the rest of my life single because people grow to hate each other and I will never trust anyone.
18622,Prompt,Would you rather have an arranged marriage or spend the rest of your life single?
18623,General Response,"I would rather spend the rest of my life single because you cannot force someone to love another. Falling in love may not be a choice, but everyone should have the choice of who they want to possibly court with and potentially marry of their own free will. Marriage should not be something that anyone should be forced into."

18630,Prompt,An app mysteriously appears on your phone that does something amazing. What does it do?

18632,Prompt,An app mysteriously appears on your phone that does something amazing. What does it do?
18633,General Response,The app would be able to let me know what others are thinking. I would be very useful in many situations in life.
18634,Prompt,"If your mind was an island, what would it look like?"
18635,General Response,It would have clear blue water around it. With a bar in the middle of the island and a cabana boy behind it. Need I say more?
18636,Prompt,"If your mind was an island, what would it look like?"

18646,Prompt,What book has influenced you the most?
18647,General Response,"The book that has influenced me the most is The 39 Clues series, because it's about a group of kids on a road trip all over the globe to win a treasure hunt, and they not only have to use their brains to solve the puzzles but also have leadership skills and I think that even though it's a kids book, a lot of people will enjoy the series."
18648,Prompt,What book has influenced you the most?
18649,General Response,"I would have to say Harry Potter. I think that at a time growing up when reading was really only something I did for school, harry potter taught me that I can read for fun and it's something I enjoy. I feel like I wouldn't have learned half the things I have it it weren't for Harry Potter."
18650,Prompt,What book has influenced you the most?

18672,Prompt,Would you rather have to eat only warm food or have to eat only cold food?
18673,General Response,"I would rather have to eat only warm food because then at least I could stick to things like cooked rice, whereas with cold food my options would be more like Ice cream all the time, which would be far worse health wise and I would get bored of faster."

18702,Prompt,What makes you nervous?

It is commonplace now to have gay relationships shown on screen."

18856,Prompt,What do you think of tour group packages?

I spend so much time trying on different shirts with the same pair of pants or vice versa just because you can't really wear two patterns. So I would go all out on some miss-matched sweats and tees."

19356,Prompt,Would you rather get good grades or be good at sports?
19357,General Response,"I would rather get good grades than be good at sports, getting good grades gives me more potential for a successful future than sports would."
19358,Prompt,Would you rather get good grades or be good at sports?
19359,General Response,I would rather have good grades. This is because if I was good at sports then what. What if I get injured? If I broke my leg I would still have the brains to live my life then to live in the spot light of sports fame. Brains has always beat brawn throughout history.

19361,General Response,"Good grades for sure.  I've never been a sports person, but academics can lead you so many places."

19387,General Response,"I would rather fly all over the world with my true love, because if that existed it would be pretty cool. I don't think true love is real, love is ephemeral and always changing, best to avoid it really."
19388,Prompt,Would you rather fly all over the world with your true love or be marooned on an island with your favorite celebrity?
19389,General Response,"I would rather fly all over the world with my true love than to hang out on an island with a celeb.  I don't like celebrity worship, but I love my sweetheart.  I also love to travel, and there is nobody I'd rather travel the world with than my love."
19390,Prompt,Would you rather fly all over the world with your true love or be marooned on an island with your favorite celebrity?

19395,General Response,"The bible. I think its a book thats really point of view and its why there is so much fighting about religon because it is just that , all about point of view and how one person sees it may not be the same as someone else and then the other person gets offended because they cant agree and how dare you deny God when its just point of view."

19402,Prompt,What book has had the biggest effect on the modern world?
19403,General Response,"This could be a subject of hot debate, but thinking about the world today one candidate would certainly be the Koran.  At a time when there is war throughout the Middle East and Arab speaking countries, where hundreds of millions of people base their entire lives and their political views on this book, its importance cannot be doubted."

19410,Prompt,Would you rather work the job you have now for a year at double your current rate of pay or have one year off with what you are making now?
19411,General Response,"I would rather have a year off. The freedom to experience a year off as an adult and not as a child would be invaluable and liberating. The double pay is tempting, but it will not reward you with time."
19412,Prompt,Would you rather work the job you have now for a year at double your current rate of pay or have one year off with what you are making now?
19413,General Response,I would rather work the job I have for a year at double the rate of pay. That way I could pay off all my bills and save up for some time off.

19416,Prompt,What is your favorite sport to watch or play?
19417,General Response,"My favorite sport to watch is men's volleyball. And it's not just because of the tight shorts and sweaty guys. It's s fast paced and these men spike the ball HARD!

19418,Prompt,What is your favorite sport to watch or play?
19419,General Response,"Basketball is my favorite sport to watch. It wasn't always this way. Since getting with Jay, who is a huge basketball fan, I've really grown to love the sport. Playing it, on the other hand? Not really for me. I don't like the back and forth. I'm too slow. I'm much better playing a sport that requires stamina without super fast moves, like triathlons or maybe soccer? I could be the gollie, right? I'd get to just chill out on the field and get a nice tan!"
19420,Prompt,What is your favorite sport to watch or play?

19424,Prompt,What is the strangest movie you have ever seen?
19425,General Response,"Happy. I really didn't like it, but I felt compelled to watch it to the end because I was hoping it would redeem itself. I'm not saying it was a bad movie, it was well done and thought provoking however it was too much not what I expected, which is why I felt it was so strange. And it was seriously depressing."
19426,Prompt,What is the strangest movie you have ever seen?

19434,Prompt,Would you rather be able to live under water or live in outer space?
19435,General Response,"I really think I would rather live in outer space than under water. In my opinion, if you die in outer space because of aliens or getting caught in a black hole, that's pretty awesome. Your body will be scattered among the stars. However, if you die in the ocean? You become fish food. That's a lot less fantastic."
19436,Prompt,Would you rather be able to live under water or live in outer space?
19437,General Response,"I think I would choose outer space, I think the gravity would be fun. I think being under water seems scary."

19447,General Response,"I don't think that unicorns are real.  I am a skeptic, so it is very hard for me to think of something that most people don't believe that I do believe.  On the contrary, I think there are many things that people do believe that I don't believe."
19448,Prompt,Are unicorns real? What is real that not many people believe?

19453,General Response,Unicorns are not real. A real issue that people seem to not address is mental illness. It has lead to many family tragedies.

19460,Prompt,How often do you binge watch shows?
19461,General Response,"I absolutely love binge watching TV shows. My favorite thing to do is stay up late on Netflix watching shows like Dr. Who or Battlestar Galactica. Last weekend, I watched the entire Stranger Things series in one night!"
19462,Prompt,How often do you binge watch shows?
19463,General Response,"I binge watch shows very often. Netflix and Amazon make it so easy to sit on your couch for hours and watch whole seasons. When some of my favorites come out, its nothing to watch a season in a weekend."

It will just have to wait I have more important matters to attend to.

19476,Prompt,What kind of interior do you like a restaurant to have?
19477,General Response,"It depends on the type of food that is served. When I think of an Italian restaurant, I think of Tuscan style brickwork and masonry. With a service of Mexican food I would expect lively music and bright, vivid colors. I'm a chef myself, so I've always dreamed, jokingly of course, of opening a Star Wars themed Italian restaurant called the Tuscan Raider. Obviously, C3-P0 would be the host."
19478,Prompt,What kind of interior do you like a restaurant to have?

19484,Prompt,What is the fanciest restaurant you have eaten at?

19486,Prompt,What is the fanciest restaurant you have eaten at?
19487,General Response,"The City Club in Portland, Oregon. I thought it was awful, the food was fine, but the waitress was better dressed than I was and it was awkward. My date was awful too and I ended up leaving for the ladies room and ducking into the elevator and driving myself home. There was no 2nd date."
19488,Prompt,What is the fanciest restaurant you have eaten at?
19489,General Response,"The fanciest restaurant I have ever been in had $130 steaks, can you believe that?

It was very extravagant and extra and I felt so out of place, but it was really good food."
19490,Prompt,What is the fanciest restaurant you have eaten at?
19491,General Response,"I have worked in a few ""fancy""restaurants and being behind the scenes, or the ""curtain"" so to speak really puts things in perspective. I guess the most costly and ""fancy"" of eating out experiences I have had was on an anniversary with my husband where we went to a French restaurant and splurged. I still remember some moments from that meal, but for some reason I do not remember the most costly component which was the main course. I only recall the appetizer and the dessert and some of the drinks my husband chose to spend our money on! He was a big spender when it came to drinks!"
19492,Prompt,What is the fanciest restaurant you have eaten at?
19493,General Response,"I once went for an interview at this place called Chesapeake's.  It's not really that fancy of a place, but it's a seafood restaurant...and I'm allergic to seafood.  When I told the waitress about my allergy, the chef came out, spoke with me about my allergy and prepared a meal just for me.  I was really impressed and still brag about how well they took care of me."
19494,Prompt,Would you rather be on a game show or star in a soap opera?
19495,General Response,"If I had top choose between being on a game show it star in a soap opera, hmm? That's tough on one hand I'd make for site money as a star on a soap but it would be way more fun to play on a game show.  If I could be the host of the game show I'd choose that, however I cannot so I choose the star of the soap opera."
19496,Prompt,Would you rather be on a game show or star in a soap opera?
19497,General Response,"Wow, that's a hard one. Win money or get close to Victor Newman. I think I would take Victor and the game show."
19498,Prompt,Would you rather be on a game show or star in a soap opera?

19542,Prompt,Would you rather lose half your hearing or half your seeing?
19543,General Response,I would rather lose half my hearing. I'm tired of listening to people's drama anyways. My eyesight is important to me.
19544,Prompt,Would you rather save the life of an elderly family member or the life of a child to whom you are not related?
19545,General Response,"Absolutely.  I respect all life and a person in need in a life saving situation, I could do nothing else but go and save or help them.  It is in my nature to help others. I would have no hesitation at all.  If I did nothing I would never forgive myself"
19546,Prompt,Would you rather save the life of an elderly family member or the life of a child to whom you are not related?
19547,General Response,I rather save the life of a child because they deserve a chance to enjoy life while the elderly member has had their chance at life.
19548,Prompt,Would you rather save the life of an elderly family member or the life of a child to whom you are not related?
19549,General Response,I would rather save the life of a child even though we were not related because they have so much life to live.  I like to think that an elderly family member would understand and feel the same way.
19550,Prompt,Would you rather save the life of an elderly family member or the life of a child to whom you are not related?
19551,General Response,I'd rather save the life of a child.  an elderly family member has limited time left.  I'd love to save the life of any family member.  but the fact is that to save the life of a child is more significant.  a child has many years to live and many things to potentially accomplish.
19552,Prompt,Would you rather save the life of an elderly family member or the life of a child to whom you are not related?
19553,General Response,"Even though it would be a difficult choice, I would probably save the life of a family member over someone else.  This is a hard choice because a child is presumably innocent and would deserve to live.  Hopefully I could save both lives and wouldn't have to choose."
19554,Prompt,What is the strangest app you have heard of or tried?
19555,General Response,The strangest app I have ever heard of was one that altered your photos into funny faces.  I always wondered why anyone would ever want to do that to their good pictures.

19557,General Response,The strangest app I have ever tried was the dating app POF.  People are so weird!
19558,Prompt,What is the strangest app you have heard of or tried?
19559,General Response,"The strangest app I have ever seen and heard of is the x-ray app.  It tricks users into thinking they can see their bones if you put your smart phone up to your hands, legs and feet and so on.  I guess to each their own."
19560,Prompt,What is the strangest app you have heard of or tried?
19561,General Response,I think there was an app that I saw in the play store that was to catch a ghost in your phone lol
19562,Prompt,What is the strangest app you have heard of or tried?

19564,Prompt,"If one animal was made the size of an elephant, which would be the scariest?"
19565,General Response,I think if a rabbit was made the size of an elephant that is would be deadly scary. Rabbits hop and move very quickly. Imagine a rabbit the size of an elephant hoping around and running from place to place. It would destroy everything.
19566,Prompt,"If one animal was made the size of an elephant, which would be the scariest?"
19567,General Response,"It would have to be a cockroach. Cockroaches are probably the scariest thing on this planet at their current size, so if they could be the size of an elephant, I don't think I could handle that. Not to mention that if you had a cockroach in your house, it would probably crush your house, and you. So that sounds horrible."
19568,Prompt,"If one animal was made the size of an elephant, which would be the scariest?"
19569,General Response,snake. I really would hide for ever in my house if a snake was made to be the size of an elephant. They scare the heck out of me and I believe at one point in dinosaur days there was a snake that big.

19571,General Response,I think the scariest animal if it were that size would be an alligator !
19572,Prompt,"If one animal was made the size of an elephant, which would be the scariest?"
19573,General Response,"I'm torn between a scorpion and a komodo dragon. On the one hand, scorpions have claws and stingers but on the other hand, a komoto Dragon's can kill you with a single bite. I think I'm going to go with scorpion."

19582,Prompt,Where do you spend most of your free time / day?
19583,General Response,"Being a stay at home mom to a new baby, I rarely have free time. There's house work, doctor's appointments, child development classes, keeping the baby entertained, helping the baby reach all of his milestones,  trying to do some surveys and Mturk work to earn a little extra petty cash while fighting to keep the baby who suddenly woke up from a dead sleep from eating the device I'm using, comfort feeding a growing, teething baby in the middle of a leap, fighting the urge to rearrange everything and paint the house because you're going stir crazy,  and fending off visitors who just want to criticize everything you're doing. When my husband comes home and takes over baby play time,  I finally get a break from all of that, I like to just sit and relax with my cats."
19584,Prompt,Where do you go and what do you do to wind down/relax?
19585,General Response,"To wind down and relax, I do yoga in my living room. It's the best medicine for taking away a headache or soothing your achey bones."

19590,Prompt,Where do you go and what do you do to wind down/relax?
19591,General Response,"Funny enough, being home with my friends and family is relaxing. Just having a simple conversation with my mother I enjoy, listening to her explain how her day went, or me explaining to her how my day went. I don't need to go anywhere extravagant to feel relaxed. I would rather be around people I actually care about."
19592,Prompt,Where do you go and what do you do to wind down/relax?
19593,General Response,I play slot machines on my computer through various sites.  I don't have to think about anything and by doing this I am not hurting my finances at all.
19594,Prompt,Would you rather live out in the country or in the city?
19595,General Response,"I have always wanted to live in the country. Country living appeals so much more to me than city living. The idea of having wide-open spaces within reach and thew opportunities for hiking, scenery and no city congestion makes my head spin."
19596,Prompt,Would you rather live out in the country or in the city?
19597,General Response,I prefer living in the country because it is more peaceful and safer.  You can always commute to the city for a job.

19602,Prompt,Would you rather live out in the country or in the city?

19604,Prompt,Would you rather eat a dead bug or a live worm?
19605,General Response,Dead bug. Definitely would rather eat a dead bug. I don't want to feel it moving or fear that it's trying to burrow inside me somehow. Please make sure my dish is served ready and dead!
19606,Prompt,Would you rather eat a dead bug or a live worm?
19607,General Response,I would rather eat a dead bug because for the most part they are crunchy. I also wouldn't have to chew it fast in order to stop it from crawling around in my mouth.
19608,Prompt,Would you rather eat a dead bug or a live worm?
19609,General Response,Dead bug for real! I couldn't imagine putting something in my mouth that's slimy and squirmy.
19610,Prompt,Would you rather eat a dead bug or a live worm?
19611,General Response,certainly the dead bug for one reason...because it's dead.  I'd rather not swallow something living.  and the feeling of the worm sliding down my mouth would almost certainly make me physically sick.  to eat a dead bug would be bad...but quick and relatively painless.  I'd just think about something pleasant and get it over with.
19612,Prompt,Would you rather eat a dead bug or a live worm?
19613,General Response,"Ewe that's a tough one I'm not guessing neither is an option here?? 

I mean it's not right?? 

Yeah thats what I was afraid of  ummm I'd probably have to go with the dead bug.  Yupdefinitely the bug there is just no way I could deal with a slimy worm wiggling down my throat and the thought of chewing something still alive I mean that just seems so wrong on so many levels, yeah, yep, nope just not happening.  Hmmmm I wonder what kind of dead bug they had in mind? I mean can do you think Id be able to mince it up and drown it in a flavorful meal or is it just crunch crunch.. swallow?"
19614,Prompt,Tell me about a time you got away with something you should not have been doing?
19615,General Response,I would cut high school a lot and forged my mothers signatures on excuses for absentees. I was so proud of myself being able to get her signature correct. It took me five years to finish high school. Guess the joke was on me.
19616,Prompt,Tell me about a time you got away with something you should not have been doing?

19626,Prompt,Have you ever been in a helicopter? What was it like? Or what do think it would be like?
19627,General Response,"No, I haven't been in a helicopter, yet. I say yet because I think that it would be fun to be up in the sky looking down on things. I actually would want to learn how to fly a plane. I think it would be interesting and quite the view. I may be nervous at first, but it is something I would like to do. I think flying in a helicopter would be a great way to see my local city!"
19628,Prompt,Have you ever been in a helicopter? What was it like? Or what do think it would be like?
