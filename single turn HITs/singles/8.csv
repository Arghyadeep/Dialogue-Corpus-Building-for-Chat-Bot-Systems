I really enjoyed doing all of the touristy stuff there.  One of the highlights of my visit was being able to see the red light district.  Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands, and there was a really interesting street that was very narrow, and got narrower as you walked down it, and it had doors that led to small rooms with just a bed, and each room had a window where the girls would stand and beckon men to come inside and have sex with them.  That whole area of town had many businesses whose focus was sex.  There were live sex theaters and many shops that had sex toys for sale.  Another place we saw during our visit was the Heineken brewery.  That was very interesting.  And, we went to a couple of ""coffee"" shops.  In reality, these coffee shops were places where people would go to smoke marijuana or hashish.  This activity is also legal in the Netherlands.",""
