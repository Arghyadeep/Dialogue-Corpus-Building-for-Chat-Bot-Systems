Being poor is a situation I can overcome. I might not ever become rich, but I would have the things that really count in life: True love, caring, dedication, devotion, companionship. My husband and I would be able to find ways to survive financially. It might not be easy but it would be worth it. 

Being rich and alone would  be harder. You would begin to hate people because you would realize that people don't truly care for you, only what you can give them or do for them. 

There is a chance that being poor and having your true love wouldn't work out either. A lot of couples, who truly love each other, fight and break up over money issues. Lack of money to take care of one's loved ones can change a person's personality. How many horror stories have been on the news about a spouse that committed domestic violence, or even murder and it is said about that person that they used to be a wonderful person until losing their job or financial troubles began and they started drinking or doing drugs. 

Human beings need love and companionship. Now that is not to say I wouldn't prefer being Rich and having my True love together. We would be able to accomplish so much more in life and help others.","This was interesting as I hadn't thought about this."

There are a number of movies that live up to the books they're based on, and can be just as powerful. A few examples? To Kill a Mockingbird is right on par with the book and just as moving. To Kill A Mockingbird is amazing in its own right, as the novel is told from the perspective of the Chief, while the movie follows Jack Nicholson's character. Personally, the first movie I saw in theaters was Star Wars, and not only did it change the face of cinema, it became the focal point for my life development.","None"

2). Pretty Place, Cleveland SC 
It's an outdoor chapel built on side of a mountain. Very special place to me that I just like to go there when nobody is there, be still, listen. 

3). Tulum Ruins of the Maya.., just totally stunning! 

4). Lake Jocassee, Salem SC 
Cold mountain lake fed by 3 rivers. Water is over 300 feet deep in some places, crystal clear all the way to the bottom, the rock formations underneath the surface just unbelievable. Surrounded by blue mountains, waterfalls galore, and has the whitest sandy beaches. The preserve around it has 80 species of plants that grow there and nowhere else on the planet. Is my favorite place on earth.",""

When I went to college in the mid to late 1970s, I could never imagine a person getting educated on-line.  I would have thought that would be something that wouldn't happen for, maybe, another century.  I think it's wonderful that people can organize their life around their education; take courses from the comfort of their own home.  However, and perhaps it's because of my age, I think there's something lacking in it...I think it's more interesting when people are in the same room exchanging ideas.  I know about chat rooms but it's not the same as being physically in the same place as others.  So I think online education is good, but certainly not ideal.",""
