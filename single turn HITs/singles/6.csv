Due to the fact that both Tom and Judy were without their spouses they married out of convenience. Judy would take care of her children as well as Tom's children and Tom would provide money for the families. Judy was not a nice woman and did not treat Tom's children well and gave them scraps and her children received the best of care. Tom eventually died at his job on the shipyard. This left Judy with all 12 of Tom's children as well as her 2 children. She received a substantial life insurance policy that Tom had taken out. She also received a large sum of money from the shipyard since Tom died during his job. Judy decided she would send Tom's children to an orphanage and use the money to take care of her children.

Since there are many different types of sauce it would come down to your personal taste, I enjoy a sweet and spicy type. You want to soak the meat in the marinade for at least 30min to 1 hour ensuring flavor is drawn into the meat. Then place the meat on the grill and let it cook for about 4-5 mins on 1 side all while continually glazing the meat with the leftover sauce.

Little clay pots make great cloches for protecting young plants from overnight frosts.
Here, the latest tips and tricks from Paul James, host of Gardening by the Yard:

1. To remove the salt deposits that form on clay pots, combine equal parts white vinegar, rubbing alcohol and water in a spray bottle. Apply the mixture to the pot and scrub with a plastic brush. Let the pot dry before you plant anything in it.

2. To prevent accumulating dirt under your fingernails while you work in the garden, draw your fingernails across a bar of soap and you'll effectively seal the undersides of your nails so dirt can't collect beneath them. Then, after you've finished in the garden, use a nailbrush to remove the soap and your nails will be sparkling clean.

3. To prevent the line on your string trimmer from jamming or breaking, treat with a spray vegetable oil before installing it in the trimmer.

4. Turn a long-handled tool into a measuring stick! Lay a long-handled garden tool on the ground, and next to it place a tape measure. Using a permanent marker, write inch and foot marks on the handle. When you need to space plants a certain distance apart (from just an inch to several feet) you'll already have a measuring device in your hand.",,,

In a pint jar you can the 3 oils, heat that in the microwave for a minute and then place the oils in a pan to heat. Check the temp of the oils and make sure they are about 120 degrees and wait for both to cool to about 95 to 105 degrees, this is very critical for making the best soaps. When both are at the right temp pour the oils into a mixing bowl and then slowly add the lye stirring till all is mixed together. Stir by hand for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes you can keep stirring or use immersion blender, the soap mixture will lighten in color and become thick. When it looks like vanilla pudding you are good to go.",,,
