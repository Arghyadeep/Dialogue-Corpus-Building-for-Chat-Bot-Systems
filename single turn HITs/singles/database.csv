375,prompt,Would you rather be rich and alone or be poor and find true love?
376,General Response,"I would rather be poor and find true love. Being poor is a situation I can overcome. I might not ever become rich, but I would have the things that really count in life: True love, caring, dedication, devotion, companionship. My husband and I would be able to find ways to survive financially. It might not be easy but it would be worth it. 

Being rich and alone would  be harder. You would begin to hate people because you would realize that people don't truly care for you, only what you can give them or do for them. 

There is a chance that being poor and having your true love wouldn't work out either. A lot of couples, who truly love each other, fight and break up over money issues. Lack of money to take care of one's loved ones can change a person's personality. How many horror stories have been on the news about a spouse that committed domestic violence, or even murder and it is said about that person that they used to be a wonderful person until losing their job or financial troubles began and they started drinking or doing drugs. 

Human beings need love and companionship. Now that is not to say I wouldn't prefer being Rich and having my True love together. We would be able to accomplish so much more in life and help others."

381,prompt,Would you rather be rich and alone or be poor and find true love?
382,General Response,"I would rather be rich and alone. I have found that true love is overrated and you can never overrate money. Also, money can buy you love."
383,prompt,Would you rather be rich and alone or be poor and find true love?
384,General Response,"I think poor, but it really depends on how poor. There's a lot of suffering that happens to people because of the lack of money."
385,prompt,I am genuinely interested. What is one song you will never skip on your playlist?

400,General Response,It is definitely an overrated lettuce. It's disgusting and there's nothing super about it in my opinion.
401,prompt,"Kale, super food or overrated lettuce?"

403,prompt,"Kale, super food or overrated lettuce?"
404,General Response,I think calling Kale overrated lettuce is an insult to lettuce. Nothing short of it curing cancer would convince me Kale is worthy of being used for anything other than a decoration. I am immediately suspicious of anyone claiming to enjoy Kale.

443,prompt,Would you rather have the power to make anyone fall in love with you or be able to read minds?
444,General Response,"Read minds. All of the people I love, love me back (except my cats), so I don't need that power. I'd be able to know what my baby needs when he's upset, know where to pet my cats, know what's bugging my husband when he ""doesn't want to talk about it"", what to get my dad for Father's Day/his birthday/Christmas, and I'd be able to annoy people by repeating back what they're thinking in a mocking tone when they make me angry. I'm really petty..."

593,prompt,Would you rather have to use a public toilet that is extremely dirty and dark or one that has a snake in it?
594,General Response,"I eat enough fiber; I don't need a snake to scare the crap out of me. Plus, I've been to some shady pubs before. Those bathrooms could have had a crocodile in them and I might not have noticed."
595,prompt,What do you think of buffets?

597,prompt,What do you think of buffets?
598,General Response,"I personally have no idea how buffets stay in business! I mean, every time I go into one of those restaurants there are people in there that act like they've never seen food before and have been told they'll never get the chance to eat again. They just mound their plates to the point of overflowing. I think buffets would probably make more money if they charged some sort of special valet service to roll guests who are too full back out to their cars."
599,prompt,What do you think of buffets?
600,General Response,"I love to go to buffets because you are not limited to one dish on the menu. If you have a craving for different items, you can just select what you want for one single price. In the long run, I believe it is a better deal."
601,prompt,What do you think of buffets?
602,General Response,"I think that buffets are great restaurants to go to if you have a family, or just like to eat and have a variety of foods for one price."
603,prompt,What do you think of buffets?
604,General Response,"I love the idea of unlimited food, but they are so unsanitary.  People sneeze and reuse utensils all the time."

617,prompt,How can governments make education more efficient?
618,General Response,"Im a teacher and there are many ways I think education can become more efficient. First they should cut out some holidays, change the school hours from 9-5 to accomodate parents and when there is no school for weather related issues have online courses or online assignments and teach via computer. They should take the business people out of the equation that make decisions on teaching and curriculum. These people have never been educators they are business people."
619,prompt,How can governments make education more efficient?
620,General Response,They can do away with so much restriction on school stuff and remove religion from the places it shouldn't be.
621,prompt,How can governments make education more efficient?
622,General Response,"I think if the government gave more money to education than wellfare, it would improve a lot. The education budget just keeps getting cut when we should be building it up. Our kids deserve the brightest, and most successful future they can possibly have, but are getting held back by a government that refuses to give up their own paychecks for a greater America."
623,prompt,How can governments make education more efficient?
624,General Response,"By putting more funding into education. It would also be helpful of they would quit regulating the way things are taught and allow students to learn different methods that work for them. Example: I had a math problem that I didn't understand when I was in, I think 6th grade. My dad explained a different way to do it and I got it right away. I got the problems I used that method on wrong because I didn't use the method the teacher taught. I had all of the answers right and I showed my work, but I didn't use the same method as everyone else."

627,prompt,Would you rather be a chef or a server?
628,General Response,"I would rather be a chef than a server because chef's get paid more, duh!

""You eat what I make or you don't eat!"" As my mother used to say."
629,prompt,Would you rather be a chef or a server?

637,prompt,When did you realize people had accepted you as an adult?
638,General Response,"When they started treating me as an equal. I don't have a specific time, it varied with different people. Even though I'm paying my own bills, married, have a child, and own a house, I have an aunt that still treats me like a child."
639,prompt,When did you realize people had accepted you as an adult?
640,General Response,"I realized people had accepted me as an adult when I was in a class for college and I was auditing it, and some students came up to me and started asking me questions, like I was a special lecturer or something."
641,prompt,When did you realize people had accepted you as an adult?
642,General Response,"I realized people had accepted me as an adult when I stopped getting carded while buying alcohol. I practically have to force people to check my age. I keep getting the ""visual acceptance"" on my receipt which I think translates to ""she looks old""."

644,General Response,I realized that people had accepted me as an adult when they started giving me responsibilities like looking after the house and younger children

664,General Response,"I would rather live in an amusement park. There would be food and entertainment. I would not have to worry about being mauled by animals! Plus, it would definitely smell better at an amusement park and I love roller coasters!"

677,prompt,What are some strange beliefs that some people have?
678,General Response,"I believe most religions are strange. The belief in a God in the sky somewhere that helps in some ways, but also provides so much strife and struggle in others. These omnipresent beings that we are supposed to trust and implore to, but have so much wisdom and causes so much distress. People also like to carry on the myths of Santa and Tooth Fairy, which are largely based on materialism and I am not sure what their message or morals at the end of the day could really teach."
679,prompt,What are some strange beliefs that some people have?
680,General Response,"Did you know that some people believe that the only reason we have the technology we have now is because many years ago, space aliens visited earth and left some of their own technology behind? If that were true, I would be severely disappointed. I mean, they have fantastic ships full of transportation beams and instant communication translators, and they left behind an iPod? That's just not fair."

694,General Response,I remember learning to walk when I was almost one year old and being very frustrated.
695,prompt,How has technology changed the music industry?

702,General Response,"How many different ways do you want to know?  There's the ease or piracy, the spread of music through sites like Pandora, Spotify, iTunes, Amazon, etc.  There is also the ways music can be made.  Look at Gorillaz, they're completely animated, people love them!"
703,prompt,How has technology changed the music industry?
704,General Response,I think frankly it has changed music quite a bit. I have heard several live and they don't even sound close to what they do after being recorded. Apparently you don't even need the ability to carry a tune in some cases.

713,prompt,What are the three best apps on your phone?
714,General Response,"The three best apps on my phone are; Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. These apps allow me to stay up to date on my social media and to keep in contact with all my close  friends."
715,prompt,Do you text more or call more? Why?
716,General Response,"I usually text more. I've never been much of a fan of phone conversations. Perhaps it's due to the deluge of date rejections I experienced from junior high through high school. Either way, it's always been easier to express myself with the written word."

729,prompt,Describe your dream car/motorcycle and why you love it.
730,General Response,"My current dream car is very different from my dreams from childhood. I have just become to sensible and it may be no fun in my old mothering age. I want a car with good clearance, but not one that requires an additional hop and step to get into. I want a three row seating, but also great load capacity. I currently have seating, but my husband says the load capacity is not where it should be. Highly deceptive and confusing if you ask me! I want something durable, but not too big. A boring car, but with a fun paint job like a bright green! That would be nice and no carpet. Just rubber me insides that way it is fully functional. Lovely leather seats though please, because there is nothing better than worn out leather seats!"
731,prompt,Describe your dream car/motorcycle and why you love it.
732,General Response,"My dream car would be a late model Mini Cooper with all the options (except moonroof because that would be stupid when sunroof is an option.) Mini Coopers are so cool. I have an older one (2003) and it's so fun to drive, however it's so noisy inside-- I would love to have a later model if for no other reason than to have a little tiny bit less road noise."
733,prompt,Describe your dream car/motorcycle and why you love it.
734,General Response,I always thought that my dream car was a bug. I am not sure the reason other than it is cute on the outside and there was a movie about it. however now my dream car is one with enough seats to fit all my nieces and nephews AND my children but still get good gas mileage.
735,prompt,Would you rather share a toothbrush with a random stranger or kiss a random stranger on the mouth?
736,General Response,"Honestly, neither...but life or death again, I would have to pick kiss a random stranger on the mouth as opposed to the using their toothbrush, kiss on the mouth isn't near as bad as getting someone else's gingivitis."
737,prompt,Would you rather share a toothbrush with a random stranger or kiss a random stranger on the mouth?

743,prompt,Would you rather share a toothbrush with a random stranger or kiss a random stranger on the mouth?
744,General Response,"I would rather kiss the stranger than share a toothbrush.  I kiss can be a quick touch of the lips, but the toothbrush has been in the nasty depths of their mouth.  I would rather the kiss so they can keep the bulk of their germs in their own mouth."
745,prompt,Do you like documentaries? Why / why not?
746,General Response,Documentaries are great! I think what a lot of people don't get is that many filmmakers really put creative thinking into how they structure their documentaries. Often they are even more creative than narrative films since there is no need to stick to a main story line.
747,prompt,Do you like documentaries? Why / why not?
748,General Response,"Yes, I really do love documentaries.  The thing I like most about them is that I learn a lot about a subject that I may have little to no knowledge of.  I feel like I have learned something after every one."

750,General Response,"yes, I find them educational, especially the ones relating to history or science."

755,prompt,Would you rather be completely alone for 5 years or never alone for 5 years?
756,General Response,"Is this a trick question? If I was never alone, how would I pee or shower or pick my nose? Those people who were with me 24/7 would have to become very tolerant and lower their standards on what a human being should be like. Wait. Completely alone? Does that mean no phone? That might be a deal breaker."
757,prompt,Would you rather be completely alone for 5 years or never alone for 5 years?
758,General Response,I would rather be alone for five years because I would learn a lot about myself.
759,prompt,Would you rather be completely alone for 5 years or never alone for 5 years?

761,prompt,Would you rather be completely alone for 5 years or never alone for 5 years?
762,General Response,I would rather be never alone for five years  because being with people is really revitalizing and enlightening.

764,General Response,"At the moment, having zero privacy and being in a sort of grouchy mood; I think I'd rather be 100% alone for 5 years. Then I could sleep without having the people I live with wake me up."
765,prompt,Would you rather not use your computer for a month or not eat junk food for a month?
766,General Response,"Wow, talk about a no-win situation.  Either way and I'd lose.  but given the choice, I'd definitely give up junk food for a month for the simple reason that giving up for my computer for a month would be really, really hard for me.  I have become so reliant on the internet for so many things I do: taking part in fantasy sports leagues, checking sports stats, and of course doing these M-turk hits.  Not eating junk food for a month would be awful, but not nearly as awful as giving up my beloved computer for a month."
767,prompt,Would you rather not use your computer for a month or not eat junk food for a month?
768,General Response,Definitely not eat junk food for a month. I couldn't live without my computer and I would be healthier without junk food.
769,prompt,Would you rather not use your computer for a month or not eat junk food for a month?
770,General Response,"I would rather eat junk food for a month, and not use my computer. Junk food is too tasty to give up, plus I can always use my cell phone!"
771,prompt,Would you rather not use your computer for a month or not eat junk food for a month?
772,General Response,"Ok thanks an easy one. I would easily give up junk food. I need my computer for communication, work, and entertainment. Who knows, I might lose a few pounds, even though I am sitting on my ass in front of a computer all day. Now if I could just exercise once in awhile."
773,prompt,Would you rather not use your computer for a month or not eat junk food for a month?
774,General Response,"Wow, I would have to choose not to eat junk food. Is that sad? I love junk food, but if I cut junk food out of my diet, I would lose weight and save money. I don't think I would get the same benefit from not using my computer."
775,prompt,Would you rather walk barefoot in a public bathroom or through poison ivy?
776,General Response,"I'd rather go through the poison ivy, since at least I know what it is. Who knows what is on the floor of a public bathroom? I'm gagging just thinking about it."
777,prompt,Would you rather walk barefoot in a public bathroom or through poison ivy?
778,General Response,I would rather walk through a public bathroom barefoot because later i can use antiseptic to wash off the germs

781,prompt,Would you rather walk barefoot in a public bathroom or through poison ivy?
782,General Response,"I would rather walk through poison ivy. I have never gone through it, so the experience wouldn't be as bad, since it's the first time. Public bathrooms scare me, although I may have chosen the first option if it were in Valencia, Spain, because all of their public bathrooms are spotless."
783,prompt,Would you rather walk barefoot in a public bathroom or through poison ivy?
784,General Response,I would walk barefoot through a public bathroom because I can just wash them off after.
785,prompt,Would you rather have no sense of smell or smell everything around you with extra ability?

788,General Response,I'd rather smell everything with extra ability. What would be the difference between extra ability and pregnant nose? I've been pregnant 3 times so I think I had the extra ability already. No big deal!
789,prompt,Would you rather have no sense of smell or smell everything around you with extra ability?
790,General Response,I would rather smell everything more intensely because I would be able to taste things better.

803,prompt,Would you rather be 42_ or 82_?

826,General Response,"It is according to the crime I was accused of. If it were a serious crime where I could be put to death - I would make sure to go to a country that does not have a extrication treaty with the US.

827,prompt,"If you were on the run from the police for a crime you did not commit, where would you go?"

845,prompt,Would you rather have the ability to read other peoples mind or the ability to see into the future?
846,General Response,I would not want the ability to read the minds of others because even with people you like it is easy to think uncharitable thoughts that would cause a breakup or stress in friendships.

847,prompt,Would you rather have the ability to read other peoples mind or the ability to see into the future?
848,General Response,To read minds. That way the majority of it would have to do with me and I could make better choices.

855,prompt,Would you rather have live one hundred years in the future or one hundred years in the past?
856,General Response,"Oy...prior to the current Presidency I would have happily said ""one hundred years in the future"", but I am afraid it would be like living in Idiocracy and I just cannot do that."
857,prompt,Would you rather have live one hundred years in the future or one hundred years in the past?
858,General Response,"100 years in the past! No question, in some ways I am already trying to do so. We bought a piece of property last year and have started a farmstead. We are growing and raising our own food. We still use tech, but are trying to get back to a simpler way of life. It is the little things, that I love about it and make me want some more of the past. Nothing smells better then bread cooking in the oven, or laundry that has come fresh off the line. There is a sense of satisfaction that I don't get in my job that I do get from working our land. It's funny how some people react when I say we raise animals for food. People think it cruel, or gross, or too much work. Other think it is the most amazing thing ever!"
859,prompt,Would you rather have live one hundred years in the future or one hundred years in the past?

873,prompt,Would you rather never be able to say what is on your mind or always have to speak the truth?
874,General Response,I think I would rather always have to speak the truth because what is on my mind may not be kind to someone that doesn't know how to park lol
875,prompt,Time freezes for everyone but you for one day. What do you do?
876,General Response,There is so much to do in my days I guess I would be incredibly grateful and take advantage of it! I hope to somehow catch up and feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment at the end of that wonderful gift of a day. It would be a dream come true! OR maybe I would just sleep - ha! I probably might just do that instead.

878,General Response,When time freezes for everyone except me I sneak out onto football fields and create some modern art.
879,prompt,Time freezes for everyone but you for one day. What do you do?
880,General Response,"If time froze and I could move, since that will never happen, I would do something I would never do. But, I would have to collect as much treasure as possible in that time frame, because I am poor, and it sucks."
881,prompt,Time freezes for everyone but you for one day. What do you do?
882,General Response,I would travel the whole world and do things that I have never got to experience.
883,prompt,Time freezes for everyone but you for one day. What do you do?
884,General Response,"If time was frozen, I would spend hours with my daughter doing the things she loves to do at twelve. Frozen time is a wish many parents have but lack the superpower to do it."
885,prompt,"If you could make a holiday, what would it be like? What traditions would it have? What would people eat on your holiday?"

891,prompt,"If you could make a holiday, what would it be like? What traditions would it have? What would people eat on your holiday?"

895,prompt,"If animals could talk, which animal would be the most annoying and why?"
896,General Response,I think a whale would be the most annoying. Their responses are so drawn out that I would get impatient waiting for them to finish their sentence.
897,prompt,"If animals could talk, which animal would be the most annoying and why?"
898,General Response,"The most annoying animal would be the parrot because it's voice. Wait, parrots already talk don't they?"

904,General Response,"The cat would be the most annoying animal, because, they would have a purring soud to their voice"

909,prompt,Would you rather be a rabbit or a fox?
910,General Response,I would rather be a fox. The fox is a medium size hunter who tends to travel far distances to find food. As a fox I would stay on the inside of the food chain in stead of at the bottom live a rabbit.
911,prompt,Would you rather be a rabbit or a fox?
912,General Response,I would choose being a fox over a rabbit.  Everything hunts and eats rabbits.
913,prompt,Would you rather be a rabbit or a fox?
914,General Response,"I would rather be a rabbit. Rabbits are herbivores. Rabbits are soft and lovely and spend their days mating, having babies, grooming, and eating. Running from burrow to burrow. I would like to live gentler as a rabbit than be a cunning fox!"

919,prompt,What personal goals do you have?

921,prompt,What personal goals do you have?

927,prompt,What is the hardest sport to excel at?
928,General Response,"What's the hardest sport to excel at? Considering I'm a proud and accomplished geek there's only one answer for me, personally - all of them. The height of my sports experience was the 50 minutes of PE in grade school in which I was forced to climb a rope for no apparent reason whatsoever, until I finally imagined that if, by some ill fated chance, I actually managed to make it to the top and ring the bell, it would signal the End of the World and I could rest in peace."

932,General Response,I think hockey is the hardest sport to excel at. The reason i say that is you have to have great balance on the ice and that is one thing i do not do well. Also you have to be pretty fast and im not to fast.
933,prompt,What is the hardest sport to excel at?
934,General Response,Geez...that would have to boxing. I just think about having to block and move away from all those crazy punches that get thrown. The training has to be brutal.
935,prompt,Does technology simplify life or make it more complicated?
936,General Response,"Technology makes life more complicated, because it never does the thing we want it to do in the efficiency we want it done at.

938,General Response,"I think it makes life easy, we can send emails, texts and communicate with friends instantly, technology makes life fun"

940,General Response,"I think it simplifies it because answers are now litteraly at your fingertips; directions, things you don't remember, recipes, calculations."
941,prompt,Does technology simplify life or make it more complicated?
942,General Response,I really think that technology makes life more complicated because people are communicating in person less and less and are losing touch with reality.
943,prompt,Does technology simplify life or make it more complicated?
944,General Response,"It definitely does both, but overall it simplifies life.  It makes communication so much faster and convenient.  A person who has to make quick contact with someone can now achieve that.  in some ways it makes life more complicated because when technology breaks down, the results can be awful.  One example of this just happened to me in the last 2 weeks.  there was a computer break down at my local health clinic which resulted in a referral not being made to another health clinic.  I'm very upset about this; but that's another story.  But overall, it's simplified life in many ways."
945,prompt,How do you feel if you accidentally leave your phone at home?
946,General Response,I feel like i lose my mind. The one time i forget it something will happen. Like i get a flat or i need to call a family member.
947,prompt,How do you feel if you accidentally leave your phone at home?

950,General Response,"I feel annoyed and lost without my phone, I rely on my phone too much and that's sad."
951,prompt,How do you feel if you accidentally leave your phone at home?
952,General Response,"If I accidentally left my phone at home, I would feel completely lost. I would probably attempt to pull it out of my pocket several times throughout the day only to realize that I left it at home."
953,prompt,How do you feel if you accidentally leave your phone at home?
954,General Response,I don't like accidentally leaving my phone at home. I've become too used to keeping it on my person. I would feel sort of unsafe without it. I might feel like I can't call for help. I would have to remind myself that there are plenty more ways to call someone. Especially since almost everyone else has a cell phone.
955,prompt,Would you rather stay up all night helping an irritating family member with a problem or babysit a baby that will not stop crying?
956,General Response,I would rather help an irritating family member because they would at least be appreciative of my time.
957,prompt,Would you rather stay up all night helping an irritating family member with a problem or babysit a baby that will not stop crying?
958,General Response,I'd rather stay up all night with a crying baby.  The baby really doesn't know better and you just need to figure out what is bothering them and fix it.  An adult who can't figure out their own problems is honestly more annoying and they can probably wait until the morning because it's probably not an emergency anyway.
959,prompt,Would you rather stay up all night helping an irritating family member with a problem or babysit a baby that will not stop crying?
960,General Response,"I would rather help an irritating family member because despite their personality, they are family and they re all we have at the end of the day."
961,prompt,Would you rather stay up all night helping an irritating family member with a problem or babysit a baby that will not stop crying?

963,prompt,Would you rather stay up all night helping an irritating family member with a problem or babysit a baby that will not stop crying?
964,General Response,I would rather stay up all night helping an irritating family member with a problem. I don't really like babies. They freak me out. I think it's because I can only take care of myself.
965,prompt,What things do you do every day that you wish were automated?
966,General Response,"I wish I could just automatically wake up, meditate, do some yoga, and go for a walk or run. But I have to constantly remind myself to do these things."
967,prompt,What things do you do every day that you wish were automated?
968,General Response,Driving to work. It takes 50 minutes from my house. I wish we had those self-driving cars already. Would make that daily drive so much better sleeping an extra 45 minutes!

974,General Response,Picking an outfit! I spend way too much time in my closet trying to choose.
975,prompt,Would you rather be the boss or the employee?
976,General Response,"I would rather be the boss. I am a stay at home mother and homeschooler with three dogs and a garden. I am the boss. My husband struggles with this. He works pretty much on his own and when he comes home he is very defensive to my machinations, when it is not personal. I am just the one who is in charge and I don't skip a beat."
977,prompt,Would you rather be the boss or the employee?
978,General Response,The boss because I have an attitude and the employee can't fire the boss.
979,prompt,Would you rather be the boss or the employee?
980,General Response,I would rather be the boss because it would mean that I would have to work less menial tasks.
981,prompt,Would you rather be the boss or the employee?
982,General Response,I would have to be the boss. I'm starting a business so I never have to be an employee again.
983,prompt,Would you rather be the boss or the employee?
984,General Response,"I would rather be the boss, because I love work and I can sit and watch it all day!"
985,prompt,Would you rather have disappointing sex every night for a full year or great sex for one night?
986,General Response,I would rather have great sex for one night because it would not be worth it to put up with someone you didn't like every day.
987,prompt,Would you rather have disappointing sex every night for a full year or great sex for one night?
988,General Response,I would rather have the disappointing sex every night. At least I could enjoy his company and cuddle.

991,prompt,Would you rather have disappointing sex every night for a full year or great sex for one night?
992,General Response,"that's a tough call, but I guess I'd rather have disappointing sex every night.  It would be sex, after all, and even disappointing sex is better than very little sex.  great sex for one night? no, thank you.  one night just isn't enough."
993,prompt,Would you rather have disappointing sex every night for a full year or great sex for one night?
994,General Response,"If the sex is actually disappointing and not just mediocre, I'd rather have great sex one night than 365 days of sex that isn't fun or interesting."
995,prompt,What is the craziest thing you have seen somebody do at the workplace?

997,prompt,What is the craziest thing you have seen somebody do at the workplace?
998,General Response,I saw a group playing Cards Against Humanity on their lunch break. I would have been nervous about a manager seeing me play this game!
999,prompt,What is the craziest thing you have seen somebody do at the workplace?
1000,General Response,I craziest thing I have ever seen anyone of my coworkers do in a workplace was spend all day watching movies and not do any work. My coworker spend an entire eight hour workday watching movies.
1001,prompt,What is the craziest thing you have seen somebody do at the workplace?
1002,General Response,"The craziest thing I have ever seen somebody do at the workplace is smoke in the bathroom. To me, even if you are a smoker, there is no reason you cannot wait for a break and go outside to smoke."
1003,prompt,What is the craziest thing you have seen somebody do at the workplace?
1004,General Response,"When I worked at a placement for kids a few years back, I worked with this lady who complained a lot and liked to argue with all the staff and the children. One day on a Saturday, some of the children were acting up due to boredom so the lady got up, walked over to me and another staff and said ""I'm having a heart attack"" I'm leaving and she did. She didn't show back up to work ever again but called a few days later to say she quit to the supervisor."
1005,prompt,Would you rather never play or always lose?
1006,General Response,I would prefer to always lose rather than never play. This is so because I never play sport to win. I have always played games because I wanted to have some good time. I play with a good spirit which definitely is not a competitive one.
1007,prompt,Would you rather never play or always lose?

1010,General Response,I would rather always lose. You can still have  a lot of fun even if you lose.
1011,prompt,Would you rather never play or always lose?
1012,General Response,"I would much rather always lose.  At least when you play you get to have fun even if you lose, I play for the fun not the outcome."
1013,prompt,Would you rather never play or always lose?
1014,General Response,I would rather never play because the potential to win is the most fun aspect of playing a game.
1015,prompt,Would you rather be a giant mouse or a tiny elephant?
1016,General Response,a tiny elephant because I feel like people would try to kill a giant mouse.
1017,prompt,Would you rather be a giant mouse or a tiny elephant?

1033,prompt,Who are some of your favorite athletes?
1034,General Response,"I know it's not popular to still like Lance Armstrong but he's still inspirational despite the asterisk by his name. Some close favorites are Rosy Greer (because it's just kind of awesome that he did needlework, sometimes during games) and Michael Jordan (because he's just awesome at everything except appearing in movies with animated characters, that was a mistake, and baseball- he can't do baseball.)"

I am a better person and am trying to pursue a better me with each day, because they are in my life. Having children around puts life in perspective. You struggle with your neuroses and your denials. They help you face your truths, because they see things with so much clarity."

1062,General Response,"My high school teacher, Alisha.  She changed my life and made me graduate and get that diploma."
1063,prompt,"Who, besides your parents, had the biggest impact on your life?"
1064,General Response,"My music teacher, Mr. McNabney that I had when I was in middle school. He taught me how to play the cello and the bass. Before that, I did not have an opportunity to learn how to play an instrument. My parents were divorced when I was young and we moved around a lot. I just so happened to be placed accidentally in an advanced math class, and he scouted our class because he was short of cello and bass players for the orchestra. Usually students started the orchestra in the 4th grade. But he took the time to start training me in the 6th grade because he saw that I had determination in learning how to play an instrument."

1077,prompt,"Describe your visit to another country, or describe a country you would like to visit."
1078,General Response,I went to Turkey a few years ago & had an amazing time. The sites to see are amazing and the people are very nice.

1087,prompt,Who is someone who is popular now that you really like? Why do you like them so much?
1088,General Response,I really like Jennifer Lawrence. I think she's a good actress and is in a variety of really good movies.
1089,prompt,Who is someone who is popular now that you really like? Why do you like them so much?

1093,prompt,Who is someone who is popular now that you really like? Why do you like them so much?

1120,General Response,Megadeth Symphany of Destruction gets to me and can take any mood and change it.

1123,prompt,What song always puts you in a good mood?
1124,General Response,Start of Something Good by Chris Daughtry always puts me in a good mood because it is an amazing song and I love it.

1131,prompt,"Do you like to read in public places, like a coffee shop?"
1132,General Response,"I don't like to read in public places because I find it distracting.  I would be watching the different people pass by, rather than reading the book.  I like to read at home where it is quiet and there are no distractions."
1133,prompt,"Do you like to read in public places, like a coffee shop?"
1134,General Response,Not really. I can never really concentrate in public places. It always seems to be too loud and distracting.
1135,prompt,Would you rather be able to fly everywhere you want or be invisible?
1136,General Response,"I would rather be able to fly everywhere, because if I wanted to be invisible I would fly up far away, then it's practically like I'm invisible. But, really I think about being a bird and flying over the ocean everyday."
1137,prompt,Would you rather be able to fly everywhere you want or be invisible?
1138,General Response,"I would like to invisible, imagine all the things I could see and how much money I would save by not paying for entry!"

1146,General Response,I would rather own my own island. The reason i say that is because i could build a bunch of property if i wanted to. I could make money off that or enjoy it with family.
1147,prompt,Would you rather own your own boat or your own island?
1148,General Response,"I would rather own an island because it would be more fun to build on it, and I can always charter a boat to get there."
1149,prompt,Would you rather own your own boat or your own island?
1150,General Response,This is a catch 22 because if I owned my own island I would want a boat so I could go back and forth on it.  IF I put all that aside I would chose the island because I can always hire someone to take me to my island because if I have the money to buy that I hope I would have the money to purchase a boat.
1151,prompt,Would you rather own your own boat or your own island?
1152,General Response,I would rather own my own island because land is better than material and an island is definitely worth more than a boat.
1153,prompt,Would you rather own your own boat or your own island?
1154,General Response,I would definitely rather own my own island. You could always rent a boat to get to it.
1155,prompt,Where did you go last weekend? What did you do?
1156,General Response,Last weekend I went shopping at the grocery store to get some food. I also visited my mother at her house.
1157,prompt,Where did you go last weekend? What did you do?
1158,General Response,I stayed at home last weekend and cooked. My favorite thing I made was some cheesecake cupcakes.

1160,General Response,"I hung out with some friends, we even went to the pool and played on a slip 'n slide!"
1161,prompt,Where did you go last weekend? What did you do?

1163,prompt,Where did you go last weekend? What did you do?
1164,General Response,Last weekend I traveled to my hometown to visit my parents.  I haven't seen them in over 7 months so we just got caught up on everything.  My parents had presents set aside for me from all the Holidays I had missed so it was a nice weekend spent with them.
1165,prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
1166,General Response,"OMG! Are we talking a poisonous snake or a harmless one?  I'm not particularly scared of snakes in general so if it's nonpoisonous, then definitely I'd rather hold the snake. But if it's a poisonous snake, then I'll take the bee sting on the face. Better that than risk a snake bite from a poisonous snake."
1167,prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
1168,General Response,I'd rather hold a snake because that's not painful and I am not scared of them.
1169,prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
1170,General Response,"Seeing as I'm not allergic to bees, I would rather have a bee sting me on the face. Snakes are far more menacing to me."
1171,prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
1172,General Response,"I would definitely hold a snake. I loved learning about snakes when I was kid, so they don't bother me at all."
1173,prompt,"Would you rather have a bee sting you on the face, or hold a snake?"
1174,General Response,"I would rather hold a snake, as long as it isn't poisonous.  If it is poisonous, then I would rather a bee sting me on the face.  If I could choose, I'd prefer to have the bee sting on my cheeks, away from my eyes and mouth."
1175,prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
1176,General Response,"I'm not sure what defines a sport. I believe fishing is a sport because it's competitive but I'm not sure a sport needs to be competitive to be considered a sport. Fishing is more physical than most people would expect. Video game tournaments are definitely sporting events, people are competing with their skill, knowledge, strategy, and hand-eye coordination-- it may not be an easy concept for people who grew up on Pac-Man to accept but video games have all the elements of a sport."
1177,prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
1178,General Response,"I think a sport should involve physical activity. I do not consider fishing or video game tournaments to be sports. They can still be worthwhile endeavors and competitions, but are just not sports in my mind."
1179,prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
1180,General Response,A sport is any activity that is played a certain way with a certain set of rules and can have a competitive nature. Fishing and video game tournaments can definitely be considered a sport because they fall into this category.
1181,prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
1182,General Response,A sport is where physical activity comes into play. Fishing and a Video Game Tournament is not a sport because there is not a lot of physical activity occurring in both these sports
1183,prompt,What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?
1184,General Response,"To me, physical exertion defines the word ""sport"". I would consider fishing to be a sport, however, I would consider video game tournaments to be a hobby."
1185,prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
1186,General Response,A submarine! I'd explore the ocean and be home in time for dinner. Can't do that with a space ship.
1187,prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
1188,General Response,"I'd rather have a submarine because most of the sea remains unexplored, and a space shuttle is not designed for deep space exploration."
1189,prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
1190,General Response,I would rather have a submarine. I love the water. Im not a fan of heights. I think i would like the view alot better below then on top
1191,prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
1192,General Response,"I would rather a space shuttle as they are more rare and costlier to make, I believe."
1193,prompt,Would you rather have a submarine or a space shuttle?
1194,General Response,"I would rather have a submarine because I still want to stay on Earth.  Although the idea of being so deep under water is frightening, being in outer space is even more scary to me."
1195,prompt,Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?
1196,General Response,Better to live where there are four seasons. Fashion always changes. Just prefer the change.
1197,prompt,Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?

1200,General Response,I like that the seasons change so I would prefer to live those places
1201,prompt,Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?
1202,General Response,"Okay, everybody knows that I hate cold weather with a passion. And I live in NC, so we get four seasons, even though I know our winters aren't as cold as other parts of the US...but if I could, I'd live in southwest Florida...I don't need four seasons!"
1203,prompt,Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?

1205,prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
1206,General Response,I would bring back Breaking Bad. That show was so suspenseful and I became very attached to the characters!
1207,prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
1208,General Response,"If I could bring back any TV show that was cancelled, it would have to be 2 Broke Girls. That show was so bad that I'd bring it back just to see it canceled again."
1209,prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
1210,General Response,"This is going to sound crazy that I'm still upset over them canceling Dracula with Jonathan Rhys Meyers but, come on! It made no sense. They only gave it two seasons and when they announced they were canceling it, the fans went ballistic. So, yeah... if I could bring back one show that was canceled, I'd definitely bring back Dracula with the original cast."
1211,prompt,"If you could bring back one TV show that was cancelled, which one would you bring back?"
1212,General Response,I would ask to bring back sleepy hollow. I loved that show and how they brought in icabod crane. I thought it was really interesting.

1214,General Response,I would bring back Futurama--I enjoyed watching that show a lot and would like to see more misadventures with the characters.
1215,prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
1216,General Response,The worst fast food place happens to be Hardee's. Hardee's has the soggiest french fries coupled with extremely greasy burgers and sandwiches. I've tried to give them second chances but they always seem to fail. Even their milkshakes fall short of being tasty. The food and drinks taste bland and boring time after time.
1217,prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
1218,General Response,All of them? How do you pick one out of many that will damage your health? But as far as taste goes I think it would be Arby's. If you are going to  eat unhealthy food make it count.
1219,prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
1220,General Response,"Jack in the Box is terrible, it's by far the worst fast food restaurant chain. I think though the worst fast food restaurant is a little Teriyaki place in Woodland, WA. The people are wonderful and I feel bad saying they're the worst, but nothing I've ordered there even resembles what it's supposed to be, it's pretty awful. Did I mention the people are wonderful? They are-- just order a soda or iced tea, because they really are very nice. Or pick up food there for your enemies.I'm a bad person."
1221,prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
1222,General Response,"Krystal's is the absolute worst fast food restaurant. The famous Krystal burgers are not filling, they're bland, and they have a weird texture to the meat."
1223,prompt,What is the worst fast food restaurant?
1224,General Response,I honestly can't stand eating at hardees. All there food taste like old grease.
1225,prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
1226,General Response,"Can't say that I do either, but I guess scratching my privates.  Itches happen...there is nothing other than pure nastiness that leads to someone, especially an adult, eating boogers!"
1227,prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
1228,General Response,"Scratching my privates I suppose, worst comment that could happen there is something along the lines of ""Typical man"""
1229,prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
1230,General Response,"I would rather get caught eating a booger. It's better to be judged as someone who ""just needed a little salt,"" versus, being judged as someone who might have a case of raging crabs in their private parts and spreading it to others if they don't wash their hands."
1231,prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
1232,General Response,well theyre both disgusting but eating a booger is far worse than getting caught scratching your private
1233,prompt,Would you rather get caught eating a booger or scratching your privates?
1234,General Response,"Ewwww, for real!? I would rather get caught scratching my privates. Eating a booger would just be gross. I almost want to gag thinking about it!"
1235,prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
1236,General Response,I think they are useful and are needed.  There has to be someway to measure student's knowledge and teaching success.  But I do believe that this should never be the only measure used.  These test results need to be used in conjunction with other measures.
1237,prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
1238,General Response,"Standardize test are not beneficial to student. Lesson and locations of student differ greatly across countries, especially large countries. Since students are taught differently, they are not equally tested on their intellectual ability."
1239,prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
1240,General Response,"I don't think that they're really useful at all. They are not only too easy, but also a waste of time because that's all you get taught."
1241,prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
1242,General Response,Standardized tests are unfair to the students since the individuals do not get a chance to showcase their best talents
1243,prompt,What do you think of standardized tests?
1244,General Response,"I think standarized tests are terrible as a teacher and they do not measure what students know. The teachers are only allowed to teach to the test to get high scores for the district so they can receive money and be compared to other districts. These tests do not take into account upbringing, home life, students personal struggles, mental health issues, the lack of funding in their school districts, parental life."
1245,prompt,What are your goals for the next two years?
1246,General Response,To learn as much as I can and prepare well for my future. The learning never stops though.
1247,prompt,What are your goals for the next two years?

1312,General Response,"Standing is probably way better for you, you get to work on your posture, and be more active. But the thought of standing all day sounds so exhausting, so I think I'd rather sit down. Standing would just make work even less enjoyable."

1370,General Response,"Actually I did. I was really nervous at first before I got up there. I remember that once I started, it got way easier. Looking back it was like I blurred out the audience, which was around 500 people. That's probably what made it easier, or I could have just been so nervous that I blanked out the audience from my mind. Either way, it sure helped."
1371,prompt,Have you ever spoke in front of a large group of people? How did it go?
1372,General Response,Yes I have when I was in high school they made us write speeches and read them in front of the whole 10th grade class. It didn't go so well I froze up and didn't say anything for about a minute or two I was so embarrassed.

1379,prompt,Does government have a place in regulating food? To what extent should government regulate food?
1380,General Response,The government should regulate food so that companies don't make us sick by putting out bad food.

1390,General Response,"I'd much rather be extremely attractive! Are you kidding? Can I stop working out, too? Does my attractiveness ever expire?

I'd constantly be wondering if I'm good enough, if they find me as attractive as I do them, ya know? I couldn't handle that."
1391,prompt,Would you rather marry someone who is extremely attractive or be extremely attractive yourself?
1392,General Response,"I would like to think I'm a fairly attractive person, so I think being married to someone who was extremely attractive would be a nice trade off."
1393,prompt,Would you rather marry someone who is extremely attractive or be extremely attractive yourself?

1621,prompt,Would you rather be a tiny person no taller than a few inches or a giant person over nine feet tall?
1622,General Response,I would much rather be a 9 foot tall giant because the world would be so much more dangerous for a tiny person.
1623,prompt,Would you rather be a tiny person no taller than a few inches or a giant person over nine feet tall?

1632,General Response,Neither. I would hate to have the pressure of being the best student in the school. That is like painting a target on my back for adult pressure. I would not want to be the captain of a sports team because I would be held as a figure to look up to and would have the authority over team mates. I am not the type of person that does well with power. It would go to my head.
1633,prompt,Would you rather be known as the best student in your school or be the captain of one of the sport teams?
1634,General Response,I would rather be the best student because there is more career options available to me.

So really, I guess mid to late 20's, after you finish school, live a little and get a good job would be ideal."
1651,prompt,What do you think is the best age to get married?
1652,General Response,"I think people should not get married until they are at least 30. Before that, they should be working on getting everything together and mentally preparing themselves for the moment. Getting married really young means you probably weren't really ready."
1653,prompt,What do you think is the best age to get married?

1908,General Response,"Rollin by Calvin Harris and Khaliid. It is such a good song! It has a really catchy chorus and the beat is upbeat and easy to listen to. It is such a great carefree summer song and the first time I heard it, I literally replayed it like 100 times. It just gets my body moving and distracts me from stupid life things for 3 minutes."
1909,prompt,What was the last song you listened to?

1917,prompt,What was your turning point to a more active life?

1922,General Response,"During college I never had time to go outside and be active. I was always stuck in sitting down in front of my laptop, working. I started to get really restless legs which made it so difficult for me to fall asleep at night. I also would always have a really sore neck and back from hunching over my laptop all day. It started to get really hard for me to sit at my laptop for long periods, and I realized I needed to do something. I decided to take up running just a couple times a week and it helped me so much with my restless legs and my posture."
1923,prompt,What was your turning point to a more active life?
1924,General Response,"I was getting ready to join the military and I realized I had never been physically active in my life. If I could get out of gym class in school, I did. So I printed out the minimum requirements to pass the physical exam in the military and worked towards it every day."
1925,prompt,How fast do you read?

1933,prompt,How fast do you read?
1934,General Response,"I try to absorb two books per week. Obviously it depends on the size of the book, considering I can breeze through Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle in a couple days yet spend most of that particular week delving through Stephen King's It. I'll never try to read more than two at a time though, but not for the most obvious reasons; I use a King of Hearts as a bookmark - and I only possess two of them. Maybe some day I'll buy myself another pack of cards to read a third book, but I'm content for now."
1935,prompt,Would you rather have all of your emails for the next two months made public or have your text messages read by everyone?

1952,General Response,"Oh, I would definitely skydive into that Grand Canyon. I would do that normally."
1953,prompt,Would you rather surf in shark-infested waters or jump free fall with a parachute into the Grand Canyon?
1954,General Response,"Do I have to pick on this one? They are both terrible ideas! I guess I'd take my chances with the Grand Canyon. After all, if I'm going to die, I'd rather have my last view be beautiful scenery as opposed to Jaws."
1955,prompt,Would you rather have an arranged marriage or spend the rest of your life single?
1956,General Response,I would rather spend the rest of my life single because if you don't really love or like the person you marry you're life will be miserable.

1958,General Response,Wow that is a tough question. I suppose I would rather be single for the rest of my life.

1964,General Response,"I would rather spend the rest of my life single because you cannot force someone to love another.

Marriage should not be something that anyone should be forced into."

1977,prompt,"If your mind was an island, what would it look like?"

1983,prompt,"If your mind was an island, what would it look like?"
1984,General Response,If my mind was an island it would look like Disneyland. It would be a place where people could go for a good time.

1987,prompt,What book has influenced you the most?
1988,General Response,"The book that has influenced me the most is The 39 Clues series, because it's about a group of kids on a road trip all over the globe to win a treasure hunt, and they not only have to use their brains to solve the puzzles but also have leadership skills and I think that even though it's a kids book, a lot of people will enjoy the series."
1989,prompt,What book has influenced you the most?
1990,General Response,"I would have to say Harry Potter. I think that at a time growing up when reading was really only something I did for school, harry potter taught me that I can read for fun and it's something I enjoy. I feel like I wouldn't have learned half the things I have it it weren't for Harry Potter."
1991,prompt,What book has influenced you the most?

2013,prompt,Would you rather have to eat only warm food or have to eat only cold food?
2014,General Response,"I would rather have to eat only warm food because then at least I could stick to things like cooked rice, whereas with cold food my options would be more like Ice cream all the time, which would be far worse health wise and I would get bored of faster."

2039,prompt,What makes you nervous?
2040,General Response,"I have severe social anxiety and agoraphobia which makes it rather difficult for me to do various tasks that others take for granted. I can't even travel to a Walmart parking lot without having a panic attack. I've been working on it for years, and have made some progress, but not enough for me to live a normal, routine life. I have specific ""safe places"" that I can go to with ease, like a close friend's or my parents' house, but anything outside that comfort zone is absolutely terrifying for me."
2041,prompt,What makes you nervous?
2042,General Response,The prospect of not being able to pay my bills makes me nervous because I enjoy the comfort of my lifestyle.
2043,prompt,What makes you nervous?
2044,General Response,It's funny because dangerous or life threatening situations don't make me very nervous. Take something as harmless as a cockroach or public speaking and I become a nervous wreck.

2065,prompt,What is the most annoying habit someone can have?
2066,General Response,"The most annoying habit someone can have is always trying to tell me what to do, or to direct my every move.  If I need help, I will ask for it.  Otherwise, I prefer people to keep their unsolicited advice to themselves."
2067,prompt,What is the most annoying habit someone can have?
2068,General Response,"To me, the most annoying habit someone can have is chewing with their mouth open, particularly when chewing crunchy foods or chewing gum. The noise is rather distracting and it can look gross as well."

2081,prompt,What is a movie moment that completely transformed you?
2082,General Response,"In saving private ryan in the beginning when they were on the shore during fire, the passion of life is so well expressed it was sad.  I thought about how precious life is and how men (and women) put their lives on the line so we here at home can have cheeseburgers and fries while watching tv.

So I would go all out on some miss-matched sweats and tees."

2372,General Response,"That's a good question. I mean, although I could live in my car, you know like a duplex..... a person in the front seat and a person in the back.

Since the show followed two guys trying to start a clothing brand, the first season was a bit slow, since it was hard for these guys to find any opportunities. By the time, their brand had just started to take off, and things were getting more exciting, the show was cancelled. It was sad because they didn't give it enough time to really catch on with people."
2381,prompt,Which TV show was cancelled/ended that you wish had an extra season?

2405,prompt,Would you rather marry someone who has lots of money or someone with a good heart?

2407,prompt,Would you rather marry someone who has lots of money or someone with a good heart?

Obviously, I did this when they weren't paying attention or I would have been tormented mercilessly."

2451,prompt,What is the most disgusting habit some people have?
2452,General Response,"The most disgusting habit some people have is not washing their hands, especially after using the bathroom.

2473,prompt,Do you like spicy food? Why or why not? What is the spiciest thing you have ever eaten?

2492,General Response,"The answer to this question might depend on what kind of spiders they were.  Were they poisonous black widow spiders, or tarantulas, or just little itty bitty fly catching spiders?  But since it doesn't say, I will go with the grasshoppers.  Grasshoppers are large, so they are easy to catch and get rid of, they are not poisonous, in fact if you are hungry enough you can even eat them, and although they will eat some plants and maybe some things in your kitchen like flour, they will not make a mess the way spiders will leaving webs."
2493,prompt,Would you rather have 500 spiders in your bedroom or 1000 grasshoppers in the rest of the house?

2527,prompt,Would you rather raise chickens for eggs or beef for meat?
2528,General Response,"In this case, I would rather raise the chickens for eggs. If I had bovine, it would be for milk."

2530,General Response,"I would rather raise chickens for eggs. I know it's not really any more humane, but somehow it seems better to me to rob something of its eggs (children... I guess) than of its life. Though who knows if the chickens would agree?"
2531,prompt,Would you rather raise chickens for eggs or beef for meat?
2532,General Response,I would much rather raise chicken for eggs. Chickens can be messy but the mess of a cow is much worst.

2593,prompt,"Which do you prefer, popular music or relatively unknown music?"
2594,General Response,"Relatively unknown music, definitely. I really like experimental electronic music because I like to hear all the different things music can do."

2603,prompt,Do you prefer coffee or tea?
2604,General Response,"I much prefer the taste of coffee and the smell of coffee rather than tea. Also with coffee you can add milk and sugar if you need some calories, I don't like milk and sugar in tea."
2605,prompt,"What is the craziest, most outrageous thing you want to achieve?"

2612,General Response,"The craziest, most outrageous thing I want to achieve is running a marathon. I am not a runner, but I would love to start running.

2613,prompt,"What is the craziest, most outrageous thing you want to achieve?"
2614,General Response,"The craziet and most outrageous thing I want to achieve is to become an manizer, you know like a womanizer but a woman being like that with men. I just think it would be the most fun and satifying thing to flirt with men, lead them on, and break their hearts."
2615,prompt,"What was the single, best realization you have ever had?"

I make my own pathways in life and if it doesn't resemble any mainstream image then it is perfectly normal.
2625,prompt,"Which is worse, slow drivers or slow internet. Why?"
2626,General Response,Slow internet is definitely worse than slow drivers. I require the internet to work so if it's really slow then I can't get anything done. I also like to watch streaming videos but if the internet is slow then the video will skip or stop which would make it unwatchable.
2627,prompt,"Which is worse, slow drivers or slow internet. Why?"
2628,General Response,"Slow drivers, definitely.  You might become frustrated and cause an accident trying to get around them or something!"
2629,prompt,"Which is worse, slow drivers or slow internet. Why?"
2630,General Response,"Slow drivers are not a big problem, so slow internet is worse as it can mean something that should be done in a few minutes could take an hour."
2631,prompt,"Which is worse, slow drivers or slow internet. Why?"
2632,General Response,"Since I am generally the slow driver, I would say slow internet is the worst. Not only does it affect my work, it also has a direct affect on my mood. I do not have access to information or entertainment when the internet blitzes."
2633,prompt,"Which is worse, slow drivers or slow internet. Why?"
2634,General Response,Slow internet is worse because it is more of a pervasive problem. Slow drivers are more infrequent.

2641,prompt,Would you rather wear clown makeup every day for a year or wear a tutu every day for a year?

2695,prompt,Would you rather get good grades or be good at sports?
2696,General Response,"I'd rather get good grades because it would lead, most likely, to a successful career.  Being good at sports would be nice, but being  a professional athlete would be very unlikely even if I was a real good athlete.  of course there are exceptions.  some people are good at sports, get bad grades, and are quite successful in his/her career.  but I think getting good grades increases the chances of a successful career."

I'd get to just chill out on the field and get a nice tan!"

2775,prompt,Would you rather be able to live under water or live in outer space?
2776,General Response,"I really think I would rather live in outer space than under water. In my opinion, if you die in outer space because of aliens or getting caught in a black hole, that's pretty awesome. Your body will be scattered among the stars. However, if you die in the ocean?

2787,prompt,Are unicorns real? What is real that not many people believe?
2788,General Response,"I don't think that unicorns are real.  I am a skeptic, so it is very hard for me to think of something that most people don't believe that I do believe.  On the contrary, I think there are many things that people do believe that I don't believe."

2802,General Response,"I absolutely love binge watching TV shows. My favorite thing to do is stay up late on Netflix watching shows like Dr. Who or Battlestar Galactica. Last weekend, I watched the entire Stranger Things series in one night!"
2803,prompt,How often do you binge watch shows?

2807,prompt,What is the most annoying thing about your phone?
2808,General Response,The most annoying thing about my phone is the memory space. I am forever running out of memory because I am always taking pictures and not uploading them.

2817,prompt,What kind of interior do you like a restaurant to have?
2818,General Response,"It depends on the type of food that is served. When I think of an Italian restaurant, I think of Tuscan style brickwork and masonry. With a service of Mexican food I would expect lively music and bright, vivid colors.

2827,prompt,What is the fanciest restaurant you have eaten at?
2828,General Response,"The City Club in Portland, Oregon. I thought it was awful, the food was fine, but the waitress was better dressed than I was and it was awkward.

2829,prompt,What is the fanciest restaurant you have eaten at?
2830,General Response,"The fanciest restaurant I have ever been in had $130 steaks, can you believe that?

It was very extravagant and extra and I felt so out of place, but it was really good food."
2831,prompt,What is the fanciest restaurant you have eaten at?
2832,General Response,"I have worked in a few ""fancy""restaurants and being behind the scenes, or the ""curtain"" so to speak really puts things in perspective. I guess the most costly and ""fancy"" of eating out experiences I have had was on an anniversary with my husband where we went to a French restaurant and splurged. I still remember some moments from that meal, but for some reason I do not remember the most costly component which was the main course. I only recall the appetizer and the dessert and some of the drinks my husband chose to spend our money on! He was a big spender when it came to drinks!"
2833,prompt,What is the fanciest restaurant you have eaten at?
2834,General Response,"I once went for an interview at this place called Chesapeake's.  It's not really that fancy of a place, but it's a seafood restaurant...and I'm allergic to seafood.

I was really impressed and still brag about how well they took care of me."

2836,General Response,"If I had top choose between being on a game show it star in a soap opera, hmm? That's tough on one hand I'd make for site money as a star on a soap but it would be way more fun to play on a game show.  If I could be the host of the game show I'd choose that, however I cannot so I choose the star of the soap opera."
2837,prompt,Would you rather be on a game show or star in a soap opera?
2838,General Response,"Wow, that's a hard one. Win money or get close to Victor Newman. I think I would take Victor and the game show."
2839,prompt,Would you rather be on a game show or star in a soap opera?
2840,General Response,"I would actually be a star in a soap opera just because i feel like those characters are designed to be attractive to the viewers while game shows devalue the people they display, what do you think?"
2841,prompt,Would you rather be on a game show or star in a soap opera?
2842,General Response,I'd rather star on a soap opera. I think that being in front of a live audience would be stressful. Acting around a group of people seems fairly easier.

2844,General Response,"Oh my goodness, Well that's really hard! I have always been interested in game shows like totally wanting to go on one. However, Soap opera seems kind of interesting if I were able to act."

2870,General Response,I would rather travel 100 years into the future. It would be cool to see what new things are out and what technology is like. I look back 10 years into the past and the technology already bores me.
2871,prompt,Would you rather travel 100 years in the past or 100 years in the future?
2872,General Response,This really depends on if I was able to know ahead of time what the social/economical climate would be in the future.
2873,prompt,Would you rather travel 100 years in the past or 100 years in the future?
2874,General Response,"I would travel 100 years into the past, because I would definitely not want to know what would happen and have to come back. It may put me in an impossible situation where I would want to do something about how things turn out."

2892,General Response,I'd rather save the life of a child.  an elderly family member has limited time left.  I'd love to save the life of any family member.  but the fact is that to save the life of a child is more significant.  a child has many years to live and many things to potentially accomplish.
2893,prompt,Would you rather save the life of an elderly family member or the life of a child to whom you are not related?
2894,General Response,"Even though it would be a difficult choice, I would probably save the life of a family member over someone else.  This is a hard choice because a child is presumably innocent and would deserve to live.  Hopefully I could save both lives and wouldn't have to choose."
2895,prompt,What is the strangest app you have heard of or tried?

2907,prompt,"If one animal was made the size of an elephant, which would be the scariest?"
2908,General Response,"It would have to be a cockroach. Cockroaches are probably the scariest thing on this planet at their current size, so if they could be the size of an elephant, I don't think I could handle that. Not to mention that if you had a cockroach in your house, it would probably crush your house, and you. So that sounds horrible."
2909,prompt,"If one animal was made the size of an elephant, which would be the scariest?"
2910,General Response,snake. I really would hide for ever in my house if a snake was made to be the size of an elephant. They scare the heck out of me and I believe at one point in dinosaur days there was a snake that big.

2923,prompt,Where do you spend most of your free time / day?
2924,General Response,"Being a stay at home mom to a new baby, I rarely have free time. There's house work, doctor's appointments, child development classes, keeping the baby entertained, helping the baby reach all of his milestones,  trying to do some surveys and Mturk work to earn a little extra petty cash while fighting to keep the baby who suddenly woke up from a dead sleep from eating the device I'm using, comfort feeding a growing, teething baby in the middle of a leap, fighting the urge to rearrange everything and paint the house because you're going stir crazy,  and fending off visitors who just want to criticize everything you're doing. When my husband comes home and takes over baby play time,  I finally get a break from all of that, I like to just sit and relax with my cats."
2925,prompt,Where do you go and what do you do to wind down/relax?

2931,prompt,Where do you go and what do you do to wind down/relax?
2932,General Response,"Funny enough, being home with my friends and family is relaxing. Just having a simple conversation with my mother I enjoy, listening to her explain how her day went, or me explaining to her how my day went. I don't need to go anywhere extravagant to feel relaxed. I would rather be around people I actually care about."
2933,prompt,Where do you go and what do you do to wind down/relax?
2934,General Response,I play slot machines on my computer through various sites.  I don't have to think about anything and by doing this I am not hurting my finances at all.
2935,prompt,Would you rather live out in the country or in the city?
2936,General Response,"I have always wanted to live in the country. Country living appeals so much more to me than city living. The idea of having wide-open spaces within reach and thew opportunities for hiking, scenery and no city congestion makes my head spin."
2937,prompt,Would you rather live out in the country or in the city?
2938,General Response,I prefer living in the country because it is more peaceful and safer.  You can always commute to the city for a job.

2947,prompt,Would you rather eat a dead bug or a live worm?

2950,General Response,Dead bug for real! I couldn't imagine putting something in my mouth that's slimy and squirmy.
2951,prompt,Would you rather eat a dead bug or a live worm?
2952,General Response,certainly the dead bug for one reason...because it's dead.  I'd rather not swallow something living.  and the feeling of the worm sliding down my mouth would almost certainly make me physically sick.  to eat a dead bug would be bad...but quick and relatively painless.  I'd just think about something pleasant and get it over with.
2953,prompt,Would you rather eat a dead bug or a live worm?
2954,General Response,"Ewe that's a tough one I'm not guessing neither is an option here?? 

I mean it's not right?? 

Yeah thats what I was afraid of  ummm I'd probably have to go with the dead bug.  Yupdefinitely the bug there is just no way I could deal with a slimy worm wiggling down my throat and the thought of chewing something still alive I mean that just seems so wrong on so many levels, yeah, yep, nope just not happening.  Hmmmm I wonder what kind of dead bug they had in mind? I mean can do you think Id be able to mince it up and drown it in a flavorful meal or is it just crunch crunch.. swallow?"
2955,prompt,Tell me about a time you got away with something you should not have been doing?
2956,General Response,I would cut high school a lot and forged my mothers signatures on excuses for absentees. I was so proud of myself being able to get her signature correct. It took me five years to finish high school. Guess the joke was on me.
2957,prompt,Tell me about a time you got away with something you should not have been doing?

2967,prompt,Have you ever been in a helicopter? What was it like? Or what do think it would be like?
2968,General Response,"No, I haven't been in a helicopter, yet. I say yet because I think that it would be fun to be up in the sky looking down on things. I actually would want to learn how to fly a plane. I think it would be interesting and quite the view. I may be nervous at first, but it is something I would like to do. I think flying in a helicopter would be a great way to see my local city!"
2969,prompt,Have you ever been in a helicopter? What was it like? Or what do think it would be like?

3002,General Response,that's an easy one; I'd drink food  from a baby bottle.  the thought of wearing visible diapers for the rest of my life makes me so sad...so uncomfortable...so creepy...that drinking food from a baby bottle almost sounds attractive by comparison.
3003,prompt,Would you rather drink all your food from a baby bottle or wear visible diapers for the rest of your life?
3004,General Response,I would rather drink my food from a baby bottle because I would never have to worry about spilling anything on me.
3005,prompt,"If you could call up anyone in the world and have a one hour conversation, who would you call?"
3006,General Response,"Oh man, this is so tough. Especially right now. I would have to say... the Dalai Lama. Which probably sounds silly, right? I hear he is really funny, and would like to get his perspective on things. I could use some wisdom right now, plus maybe he could give me tips on patience!"
3007,prompt,"If you could call up anyone in the world and have a one hour conversation, who would you call?"
3008,General Response,I would call Bill Gates to talk to him about the future of technology and what's the next big thing.
3009,prompt,"If you could call up anyone in the world and have a one hour conversation, who would you call?"
3010,General Response,I would love to call up Donald Trump and have a one hour conversation with him. It would be nice to hear from the man himself instead of what the news wants me to hear.
3011,prompt,"If you could call up anyone in the world and have a one hour conversation, who would you call?"
3012,General Response,I would love to have a conversation with Oprah Winfrey. She is so successful and raw. It would be a dream to pick her brain.
3013,prompt,"If you could call up anyone in the world and have a one hour conversation, who would you call?"
3014,General Response,"I can call anybody in the world? This is tough. Let me see... Okay, this is going to sound crazy but I'd call Tom Waits. I have always been a huge fan of his music but particularly his lyrics. And the few times I've seen in in movies or interviews, especially while David Letterman was still on, I just always thought, now that's a guy I'd like to sit down and talk to for a while. He seems to funny and interesting."
3015,prompt,"Would you rather sleep upside down like a bat, or eat all of your food from a feedbag like a horse?"
3016,General Response,I would rather eat all of my food from feedbag rather than sleep upside down because doing so would make me feel like fainting.
3017,prompt,"Would you rather sleep upside down like a bat, or eat all of your food from a feedbag like a horse?"
3018,General Response,I guess I'd rather eat like a horse because even thought that sounds gross there's no way I could sleep upside down without passing out.
3019,prompt,"Would you rather sleep upside down like a bat, or eat all of your food from a feedbag like a horse?"
3020,General Response,Assuming that I was comfortable sleeping upside down I would rather do that than eat out of a food bag like a horse. It is hard to function in society if you can't eat normally.
3021,prompt,"Would you rather sleep upside down like a bat, or eat all of your food from a feedbag like a horse?"
3022,General Response,"I would rather sleep upside down like a bat, not because I think it would be cool or awesome, but because the alternative posed, eating from a feed bag....is something I know I would NOT want to do. You can't hold a conversation with a feed bag over your face, and meals are a social thing for me and my family."
3023,prompt,"Would you rather sleep upside down like a bat, or eat all of your food from a feedbag like a horse?"
3024,General Response,"Like abat,because it would reverse the effects of gravity from standing all day."
3025,prompt,What was the best time period of your life? What do you think will be the best time period of your entire life?
3026,General Response,The best time period of my life was when I was a kid because I had no worries. I think the next best time period will be when I move out into my own place with my family because living with other family members can be problematic.
3027,prompt,What was the best time period of your life? What do you think will be the best time period of your entire life?
3028,General Response,My best period is being a mother. I believe it will always be the best stage of my life. My children are such beacons of encouragement and such a source of challenge that propels me to pursue and become the best of me. Having children surrounds you with so much truth. It is inevitable that you face your demons and become better for it. They have taught me more gratitude than I have ever known.
3029,prompt,What was the best time period of your life? What do you think will be the best time period of your entire life?
3030,General Response,I would have to say the best time period of my life was my teenage years. Not having major responsibilities and just living life and having fun. Now looking back I would say that this will be the best time period of my entire life because I have a wonderful family and am raising my children.
3031,prompt,What was the best time period of your life? What do you think will be the best time period of your entire life?
3032,General Response,"The best period of my life is actually right now. Being a new mom, I'm rediscovering who I am and enjoying every moment of baby snuggles. I have this picture of the future in my head of the best period of my life. In it, I have more than just the one child, I've raised them successfully and I'm sitting next to my husband, holding his hand, on the back porch of a house we built together, watching our children play with our grandkids. My husband will be the same man that I am married to now."
3033,prompt,What was the best time period of your life? What do you think will be the best time period of your entire life?
3034,General Response,"Well, so far, I think the best time period of my life is now. I have two older, established children and two younger, still very needy and cuddle, babies.

I am really looking forward to the next few decades. I am really hoping that my retirement years are the best of my life. I want to enjoy life."
3035,prompt,Can you think of any technology that has only made the world worse? How about a piece of technology that has only made the world better?

3037,prompt,Can you think of any technology that has only made the world worse? How about a piece of technology that has only made the world better?
3038,General Response,Nuclear weapons have definitely only made the world worse. Everyone is just stockpiling them so no one will attack them. I think something like solar power has been comparatively harmless and slowly making the world better.
3039,prompt,Can you think of any technology that has only made the world worse? How about a piece of technology that has only made the world better?
3040,General Response,"An example of technology that has only made the world worse is nuclear weaponry. It is a threat that provokes fear in people from around the world. The effects of a nuclear attack would be devastating and nothing good could possibly come of it. On the other hand, an example of technology that has only made the world better would have to be central heating and cooling, which have made it so one can be comfortable in their home regardless of the temperature outdoors."
3041,prompt,Can you think of any technology that has only made the world worse? How about a piece of technology that has only made the world better?
3042,General Response,I think a lot of the sonar waves have made the world worse and questionably the internet because I feel we have lost the capability of imagination.
3043,prompt,Can you think of any technology that has only made the world worse? How about a piece of technology that has only made the world better?
3044,General Response,"Computers and the Internet have made the world better, as they can quickly process information, and store a lot of old information that may be needed. The Internet, you can say, could have made the world worse. Social Media exposed a lot of horrible people with horrible opinions that should have not seen the light of day."
3045,prompt,Is it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?
3046,General Response,"It is always better to have loved and lost at least you know what love is like, it is nice to be loved and to love. If you have never lost you don't know what it is like and the purpose of life is experiences and relationships."
3047,prompt,Is it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?
3048,General Response,I believe to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. I have been through lost love and I would still do it again.

3051,prompt,Is it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?
3052,General Response,"Never loved at all. Losing someone that you loved hurts, and it can be hard to get over it if the person you lost was a significant positive influence on your life."
3053,prompt,Is it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?
3054,General Response,"No, I think it is better to never have loved at all.  I think that if you never loved, you don't know what you are missing.  However, if you love and lose it, you feel the pain of that loss forever."
3055,prompt,Would you rather have to shout everything you say or whisper everything you say?
3056,General Response,I'd rather whisper everything. People who shout randomly in public always seem crazy. You'd also probably get kicked out of a lot of places if you just kept shouting. At least with whispering I could still go see a movie or go to a restaurant without being dragged out of there kicking and shouting.
3057,prompt,Would you rather have to shout everything you say or whisper everything you say?
3058,General Response,I really dislike loud noises so if I had to pick between needing to whispered rest of my life or needing to shout I would pick whisperer. If you needed to always shout you could never have romantic relationships or work with small children.
3059,prompt,Would you rather have to shout everything you say or whisper everything you say?
3060,General Response,"I would rather have to whisper everything--I don't enjoy being loud, and I think my voice would get hoarse very quickly."
3061,prompt,Would you rather have to shout everything you say or whisper everything you say?
3062,General Response,Id rather be able to whisper but people dont listen and you will end up having to shout.
3063,prompt,Would you rather have to shout everything you say or whisper everything you say?
3064,General Response,"I would rather whisper, my dad is hard of hearing so he shouts everything he says and sometimes it gives me a headache. Whispering would just be more polite as long as everyone could hear me."
3065,prompt,What incredibly common thing in life terrifies you?

3069,prompt,What incredibly common thing in life terrifies you?
3070,General Response,Going to the doctor terrifies me so much that I get very nervous every time I have to go. I guess my knowledge is that if I don't know I will be okay.

3071,prompt,What incredibly common thing in life terrifies you?
3072,General Response,A spider is common and strikes fear into me. I dont know why they just terrify me.
3073,prompt,What incredibly common thing in life terrifies you?
3074,General Response,"Storms. I didn't mind them until last year. We bought our own home, which doesn't have a basement. Coincidentally, the tornado sirens have gone of significantly more times since we've moved. Our house also feels like it's going to be blown apart by heavy winds."
3075,prompt,What song do you secretly like but would not admit it elsewhere?
3076,General Response,"I secretly like Madonna songs, but I don't admit it normally. It seems like whenever I do, people begin to assume my sexual orientation, and I think it's important that nobody labels me or others by our likes and dislikes."
3077,prompt,What song do you secretly like but would not admit it elsewhere?
3078,General Response,"Fish Heads from Barnes and Barnes. It's just so corny, but it brings a smile to my face when I listen to it."
3079,prompt,What song do you secretly like but would not admit it elsewhere?
3080,General Response,Bon Jovi living on a prayer. Everyone nowadays hates Bon Jovi so I would say this.
3081,prompt,What song do you secretly like but would not admit it elsewhere?
3082,General Response,"The song I can secretly stand and belt out sometimes is Justin Bieber's ""Love Yourself"", only I always sing the unedited version of it and its tolerable then."
3083,prompt,What song do you secretly like but would not admit it elsewhere?

3087,prompt,Would you rather live in a place where it is always cold or in a place that is always hot?
3088,General Response,"A place that is cold is much better, and all that is needed to survive is more layers of clothing, while a hot place can be unbearable and if water or electricity runs out then it is really bad."
3089,prompt,Would you rather live in a place where it is always cold or in a place that is always hot?
3090,General Response,"I would rather live in a place where it's always cold. I love warm, cozy sweaters and sitting by the fire."
3091,prompt,Would you rather live in a place where it is always cold or in a place that is always hot?
3092,General Response,I'd rather live in a place that is always cold.  You can put on a lot of layers but you can only take so many off!
3093,prompt,Would you rather live in a place where it is always cold or in a place that is always hot?
3094,General Response,"I would rather live in a place where it is always cold. You can bundle up and add layers, but it is hard to cool off when it gets too hot. We do not have central AC in our house (most houses in WA are lacking central AC) and it was miserable hot and only 97 degrees outside. I don't like the heat!"

3101,prompt,What is the last show that you binge watched?
3102,General Response,"The last show I binge watched was Star Trek Deep Space Nine. It's my default binge watching show, I really like all the Star Trek's, but it's that Levar Burton that got me into it."
3103,prompt,What is the last show that you binge watched?

3111,prompt,Would you rather have hands instead of feet or feet instead of hands?
3112,General Response,Hands instead of feet. Then I wouldn't have to bend over to pick stuff up.
3113,prompt,Would you rather have hands instead of feet or feet instead of hands?
3114,General Response,I would rather have feet instead of hands because I could always sit down and do things .
3115,prompt,"If given the chance, would you become an astronaut even if it meant spending years at a time in space?"
3116,General Response,No. I am not a big fan of science or space exploration. I prefer to stay down here on Earth.
3117,prompt,"If given the chance, would you become an astronaut even if it meant spending years at a time in space?"
3118,General Response,I would take the opportunity to become an astronaut and spend a year in space. I love the stars and sky. I would take the time in space to read and record my experience navigating the stars so that future generations have the opportunity to understand my perspective of the stars.
3119,prompt,"If given the chance, would you become an astronaut even if it meant spending years at a time in space?"
3120,General Response,"No, I like space exploration dont get me wrong but I like my feet flat on the ground of this crazy planet"
3121,prompt,"If given the chance, would you become an astronaut even if it meant spending years at a time in space?"
3122,General Response,I would not become an astronaut because I like all the comforts that earth provides.
3123,prompt,"If given the chance, would you become an astronaut even if it meant spending years at a time in space?"
3124,General Response,"No. I was always interested in space (and dinosaurs) as a child and I love science, but I don't think I could handle the distance from my family. Plus, you can't grill chicken in space."

3135,prompt,"Would you rather borrow $10,000 from your parents or borrow $1000 from your friends?"
3136,General Response,"I would prefer to borrow $1,000 from my friends.  Borrowing $10,000 from my parents is way too much money, and it would place a burden on them and our relationship."
3137,prompt,"Would you rather borrow $10,000 from your parents or borrow $1000 from your friends?"
3138,General Response,"I'd rather borrow $10,000 from my parents. My parents would understand and would not think less of me for getting into a situation where I needed to borrow from them.

3139,prompt,"Would you rather borrow $10,000 from your parents or borrow $1000 from your friends?"
3140,General Response,"$10,000 from my parents. Heck, they may not even consider it a loan if I desperately need it."
3141,prompt,"Would you rather borrow $10,000 from your parents or borrow $1000 from your friends?"
3142,General Response,"I would borrow the $1000 from friends, because if I am to borrow money it would be a much lower amount and I can replace it readily. The $10,000 is incredibly grand amount to be borrowing from my family. I could not live with the guilt of doing that. I am the eldest and female in my family and I had a very sheltered childhood. It was heavily influenced by my culture and it would be very difficult to ask for help being the eldest. There are very high expectations of me."
3143,prompt,"Would you rather borrow $10,000 from your parents or borrow $1000 from your friends?"
3144,General Response,"I would rather borrow $1K from my friends than $10K from my parents.  First and foremost, IF I have to borrow money, I'd prefer to borrow the least amount possible.  I don't worry about borrowing from parents versus friends, because I plan to pay it back either way."
3145,prompt,What book has had the biggest impact on your life?

3149,prompt,What book has had the biggest impact on your life?
3150,General Response,"A book called ""Love 'em or Lose 'em"". It is a management book. My boss back in 2007 gave it to me before he would promote me to a supervisor position. That was my first real management position which really launched my existing career. The book taught me how to approach people that I would manage, how to be transparent and to understand different people have different currency or values at work, and how to appeal to those."
3151,prompt,What book has had the biggest impact on your life?
3152,General Response,The book that had the biggest impact on my life would be one of the mid 2000's Guinness Book of World Records. I could read that everyday as a kid and not get bored about learning useless records.
3153,prompt,What book has had the biggest impact on your life?
3154,General Response,"The Three People You Meet In Heaven. It makes you stop and think about the impact you have on others lives, whether you are aware of the impact or not."

3163,prompt,What is something new you learned this week?
3164,General Response,"I learn something new nearly every day. At least I try to. Sometimes I miss the lesson, but it comes around to my old addled brain sooner or later. I think I learned this week that my body is aging and I need to put it on an exercise regime. I did not always treat it fairly in my young age and now I may feel the repercussions."
3165,prompt,What do you think of homeschooling?
3166,General Response,"I have mixed feelings about it.  I like the thought of my children not being bullied in school, and not being victims of random violence.  However, the lack of socialization with other kids would be very harmful.  Even if my kids socialized with kids in the neighborhood, it wouldn't be as valuable as making friends with kids in school.  So all in all, homeschooling has it's advantages, but I'd probably stay away from it."
3167,prompt,What do you think of homeschooling?
3168,General Response,"I think it works for some people, but not most.  I don't think it would work for our family very much because my kids honestly listen better to other people than they do their mother when we are trying to be serious and focused about something, especially for any amount of time.  If I home schooled instead of working full time, I would also drink a lot more."
3169,prompt,What do you think of homeschooling?
3170,General Response,I think to each there own. Kids need to socialize yet a lot of schools have become absorbed with sports and socializing. Homeschooling gives the child more attention and one on one this could be good if there struggling in normal school settings.
3171,prompt,What do you think of homeschooling?
3172,General Response,I think homeschooling can be very beneficial and can help children excel at there own pace. If your goal is to get a high school diploma quickly it is also the way to go. You can excel more quickly then you could in a traditional public school. You can also control the environment that children are learning in. Where as it varies so much in public schools.
3173,prompt,What do you think of homeschooling?
3174,General Response,I think it is good to home school but only if you have the time to devote to it and the dedication to do it well.
3175,prompt,What was the first thing you bought with your first paycheck?
3176,General Response,"I honestly cannot remember what the first thing I bought with my first paycheck. I would have been fifteen at the time, so if I had to guess based on what I liked at that time it was probably either a Harvest Moon or Spyro video game."
3177,prompt,What was the first thing you bought with your first paycheck?
3178,General Response,I bought a new pair of boots with my first paycheck.  I spent almost all of it but it was a great reward!
3179,prompt,What was the first thing you bought with your first paycheck?

3185,prompt,Would you rather be bitten by a poison snake or a poison spider?

3187,prompt,Would you rather be bitten by a poison snake or a poison spider?
3188,General Response,"I would rather be bitten by a snake...I have the biggest fear of spiders. It's almost a phobia. Spiders are the only thing that frighten me to the point of tears. So yeah, I'll take the snake bite. A spider bite wold probably put me in the psych ward for a while!"
3189,prompt,Would you rather be bitten by a poison snake or a poison spider?
3190,General Response,"I would much rather be bitten by a poison spider than a poison snake. Spider bites are almost never fatal, and far less dangerous and snake bites. Plus I might have the satisfaction of swatting or stepping on the spider than bit me."
3191,prompt,Would you rather be bitten by a poison snake or a poison spider?
3192,General Response,I myself hate both snakes and spiders so this is a very difficult decision for me.  Snakes have big fangs with a lot of venom so I think I would rather be bitten by the spider because it wont be as painful.
3193,prompt,Would you rather be bitten by a poison snake or a poison spider?
3194,General Response,"Can I say ""neither""? Because neither of those options sound pleasant at all. A snake bite is so much bigger! Ok... I would choose spider. My dad was bitten by a hobo spider once, and he said it was painful, however I can't imagine it being more so than a snake bike? Unless its the worlds tiniest snake and the worlds largest spider? Yea, I choose spider. Do I get to pick the spider?"

3217,prompt,Would you rather date someone who is 10 years older or someone 10 years younger?
3218,General Response,"So I'm 40, and I would be fine with either, if I were single. When I was 30 I dated a 21 year old, and as fun as it was...we just weren't on the same page maturity wise. And who wants to be called a cougar at age 30?"
3219,prompt,Would you rather date someone who is 10 years older or someone 10 years younger?
3220,General Response,"I think I'd rather date someone 10 years younger.  I'm 61 years old and to be honest, the thought of dating someone over 70 years old is not inviting.

3230,General Response,"Teaching is a skill that can be taught and learned, but like all things it requires experience to become very good at it."
3231,prompt,Is teaching a skill that can be taught?
3232,General Response,"Yes, absolutely. I don't necessarily think it comes naturally, I just think that some people were born with younger siblings they had to help raise. These same skills can be taught to adults."
3233,prompt,Is teaching a skill that can be taught?
3234,General Response,"As a teacher i feel teaching can and can't be taught, you can certainly teach someone to teach, give the, all the material they need, explain what it will be like and what to expect.  However the passion of wanting to be a teacher comes from within and that is something that you can't teach."
3235,prompt,Are bigger or small schools better?
3236,General Response,I am a firm believer that smaller schools are totally better. The smaller schools have smaller class sizes which promote better one on one experience with student and teacher.

Another good aspect of small schools is there is less chance that students will be forgotten or left out

3241,prompt,Are bigger or small schools better?
3242,General Response,"Personally, I prefer small schools.  They allow for more individualized instruction."
3243,prompt,Are bigger or small schools better?

3265,prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Batman or Superman?"
3266,General Response,"Superman. I mean, Batman would not go down easily but Superman is a freaking alien with impregnable flesh. Sure Batman could easily buy some kryptonite with his giant fortune, but Superman always finds a way to survive. Plus, he can use his x-ray vision to see that Batman is actually Bruce Wayne and then catch him on fire with his laser eyes while he was sleeping. I've never seen Batman vs Superman, but they probably should have hired me to write that script."
3267,prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Batman or Superman?"
3268,General Response,"Oh, come on. At the end of the day, Batman is just a man who's real;y good at martial arts and has a lot of fancy toys. Superman is an alien! Let's be real, Superman would always win, hands down."

3272,General Response,Definitely Superman because he is just a better Superhero!
3273,prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Batman or Superman?"
3274,General Response,"In a fight, Superman would win, without question. He is an alien with super human strength and Batman is just a rich man with fighting training and gadgets."
3275,prompt,What do you think about the organic food movement?
3276,General Response,"It took a while for us to be a part of the organic food movement, but we are finally there. It is an inevitable step in this information age. We are processing and being approached with new information every day. Reflecting on things that we have pursued and the repercussions. Its great that people are asking questions and there are options and they are becoming more and more reasonable and accessible every day."
3277,prompt,What do you think about the organic food movement?
3278,General Response,"I buy some organic produce since they look fresher in some cases. With that said, I don't make it a point to buy everything organic."
3279,prompt,What do you think about the organic food movement?
3280,General Response,"I think the organic food movement is interesting. I am in the middle. I usually don't buy organic because it is more expensive but I also feel like non organic can be just as good, depending on how and where it was grown."
3281,prompt,What do you think about the organic food movement?
3282,General Response,If people want to waste money on food that costs more because it is organic then more power to them.  I could not care less if they food that I eat is organic or not and will never pay extra for food that is.
3283,prompt,What do you think about the organic food movement?
3284,General Response,I am torn on this one. I think the certified organic movement is a crock. It is expense and cost prohibitive for most small farmers. There are an awful lot of hoops to jump through to attaint that label. Another issue I have is that people associate organic with no pesticide use and that is not the case. Big organic farms still use pesticides and practices that are not necessarily best for the environment. Pesticides that kill thousands of pollinators such as honey bees annually. I do think that people are paying more attention to what they are eating and starting to bring their business to their local farmer.

3294,General Response,The kitchen of course! Without it the rest of the house would just be a large hotel room. No character or life to it.

3309,prompt,What would you do if you had no money?

3312,General Response,Live in the mountains so I could survive off the land.  Money isn't everything .... we all have to realize that.  One day it will all be gone and when you die you can't take it with you!
3313,prompt,What would you do if you had no money?
3314,General Response,"I would try to live off the land. I would make shelter in the woods, I would probably have to eat leaves and berries and stuff, I don't think I would be able to kill an animal to eat, but I guess if I was really that desperate I might get over it and do it."
3315,prompt,Who had the biggest impact on the person you have become?
3316,General Response,"It would have to be Louisa May Alcott. Her book Little Women shaped a lot of how I saw myself and people in the community. There were admirable characters that were kind, had depth, strove for a better community, and pushed past societal boundaries."
3317,prompt,Who had the biggest impact on the person you have become?
3318,General Response,"My father had the biggest impact on me as I grew up.  He was a Master plumber and had his own business.  He always talked to me about what I wanted to be, then he always told me to be sure and finish school, so that I could have a good job."
3319,prompt,Who had the biggest impact on the person you have become?
3320,General Response,"The biggest impact would be my first child. I jokingly tell people that much of my memory is gone since childbirth, but it is actually a reality. There is so much pressure and constant moving forward when it comes to tending to children. You need to be a step ahead otherwise you lose your foothold on being the primary caregiver in their life. I feel very responsible to be ready for anything they want to pursue, so it has been incredibly challenging and with every hurdle I am a much better, more accomplished person for it."
3321,prompt,Who had the biggest impact on the person you have become?
3322,General Response,"I hate to say it, but my ex-husband. Dealing with him has given me world class peace keeping skills and taught me the value of advocating for myself."
3323,prompt,Who had the biggest impact on the person you have become?
3324,General Response,The biggest person that has had the biggest impact on myself was my mother. She taught me hard work and independence.
3325,prompt,What is your worst experience in a foreign country?

3329,prompt,What is your worst experience in a foreign country?
3330,General Response,"I went to India for a whole summer with my family once since my dad had to move there temporarily for work. Although looking back on it, there were parts I really enjoyed, it was definitely a huge culture shock. We didn't even go to a big city, we went to a small town in the middle of nowhere. Everybody stared at us everywhere we went, since we were the only foreigners around, which was very uncomfortable. On top of that, it was just very heartbreaking to see the way people lived there. As foreigners, people assumed we had loads of money and made us feel very unwelcome. I was only maybe 11 when I went, and some beggar actually spit on my face for not giving him money, even though I was a kid and didn't have anything on me."
3331,prompt,What is your worst experience in a foreign country?
3332,General Response,"I went to Japan, and my GPS app was not working in the subway there, so I ended up boarding the wrong train and got lost for 25 hours."
3333,prompt,What is your worst experience in a foreign country?
3334,General Response,My worst experience in a foreign country is building a church in Mexico with ungrateful friends for an ungrateful organization.
3335,prompt,Would you rather be short and physically fit or tall and fat?

3352,General Response,"If I had to choose, I would probably choose the private plan because I believe that I would have more opportunities to travel more places. If I am on a time restraint for a vacation, the plane would be the fastest means. While I do love the water, I believe that the plane would be more beneficial to my needs and plans."
3353,prompt,"If you could own a private yacht or private plane, which do you choose and why?"
3354,General Response,"no question about it; I'd go with the yacht.  I've heard of too many people who lost their lives in planes; some of them private planes.  a hero of mine, the late yankee catcher Thurman Munson, died while he was trying to learn to fly a plane.  no thank you; i'll go with the yacht."
3355,prompt,"If you could visit any fictional town/place, what would it be?"

3369,prompt,Would you rather have a job that makes an impact and make very little money or become famous for something trivial and have a great deal of money?

3385,prompt,Do you think money can buy happiness?
3386,General Response,"I think money can make life easier, therefore providing a means to happiness, but actual happiness comes from within. If you are a good person, you will attract good people and having a circle of good friends will make you happier than any amount of money."
3387,prompt,Do you think money can buy happiness?
3388,General Response,"No money can't buy happiness, like if a loved 1 passes no amount of money will bring them back and losing someone you loves changes  your life. But then again money does help, you don't have to worry about how your going to feed your family, or for house and unity bills, and clothing and stuff like that for your kids. It takes all that stress away."
3389,prompt,Do you think money can buy happiness?
3390,General Response,"money absolutely can not buy happiness.  many rich people have committed suicide because of the pressure of KEEPING their money.  I do believe that if handled properly and invested wisely, money can help a person attain happiness.  but it can't guarantee it.  a person has to have other things in his/her life; such as a supportive family, a good job and things like that.  money can be a great thing. but it can't buy happiness."
3391,prompt,Do you think money can buy happiness?

3394,General Response,money can absolutely not buy happiness. we see people with money everyday who have many issues

3403,prompt,Would you rather travel 100 years into the future or 100 years into the past?
3404,General Response,"Man, that's a tough one. I think I would rather travel 100 years into the future.

My luck, I would show up in Road Warrior."

I imagine  that it's extremely difficult to be a concert pianist, but once a person has achieved that ability, it's something that he/she can't lose.  Unless something really unusual happens, that person will be able to use that talent and ability for many years.  I would think that being a stand-up comedian would be much tougher.  A comedian has to continue modifying his talents, remaining up to date...I think the pressure would be very difficult.  And to make a living doing that? Very unlikely.  I'd rather be a concert pianist, even with though I know it would be very difficult to make a living doing that, as well."

3513,prompt,Would you rather have a beautiful sporty car and an old house or a real clunker car and a beautiful house?
3514,General Response,"What a great question! Are you sure I can't have the great car and the beautiful house? Just kidding.  I think I'd take the clunker car and beautiful house.  the thought of an old house is a real turn off.

3651,prompt,What impresses you most about kids these days?
3652,General Response,Most kids these days are quite tech savvy and they get new technologies fast.
3653,prompt,What impresses you most about kids these days?

3677,prompt,What is the best way to stay motivated and complete goals?
3678,General Response,"Honestly, I sometimes have trouble staying motivated to complete goals but the best way to meet goals for me is just knowing how bad it feels when I know I have only myself to blame for something I could have accomplished."

Red because it's my favorite color and I have always looked great in red. In dresses I tend to choose classic styles. I have dresses that are 15 years old in my closet and I still wear them and get complimented on how nice I look. The latest trends mostly just look silly.

3739,prompt,What weird or useless talent do you have?
3740,General Response,"My weird talent is that my fingers are double jointed. Although, that's actually an inaccurate term. It's actually called hypermobility. I say that it's a weird talent rather than a useless talent because, when I was a kid, I used to pretend that I'd broken my fingers so that I could skip school! It didn't take them long to catch on to my trick, though."
3741,prompt,What weird or useless talent do you have?

3743,prompt,What weird or useless talent do you have?
3744,General Response,"I have a weird ability to sing like a person from an opera for a really long time. But, it's really bad, and I don't know Italian, so it's nonsense, and silly sounding."

3747,prompt,What is your favorite drink?
3748,General Response,"Hot drink or cold drink? I love coffee and it might just be my favorite drink but I do not like it cold. I use a smaller coffee cup so that what I drink stays hot. My favorite cold drink would be ice tea, plain black ice tea on a hot summer day, there is nothing better."

3750,General Response,My favorite drink is water because it revitalizes my body and refreshes me all at once.It is a life saver.

3755,prompt,What is a fashion trend you are really glad went away?

3764,General Response,The socks over the bottom of the pants and legwarmers. It was just ridiculous

3767,prompt,Would you rather live as a vegan for a month or only be able to eat meat and dairy for a month?

3769,prompt,Would you rather live as a vegan for a month or only be able to eat meat and dairy for a month?
3770,General Response,I would rather live as a vegan for a month because vegetables are more important to have than meat and dairy.

3784,General Response,I have hair that is super curly and I love it.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  I think we should all just embrace the hair we are born into.  It's perfect just the way it is!

3827,prompt,"Do you like seeing movies on the weekend with lots of people, or during the week when nobody is there?"
3828,General Response,"I also went to movies during the cheaper matinee weekday times. When there is more people there is an increased likelihood of someone spoiling your evening.

3859,prompt,Do you have something that you find strangely relaxing?

3877,prompt,"If you had a personal mascot, what would your mascot be?"
3878,General Response,The honey badger. Because those animals are absolutely badass and tough little buggers as well.

3886,General Response,"If I had the time, I would open a lounge spot, or a bar. It would be nice to work out of my own place and relax at the same time, and meet great people."
3887,prompt,What hobby would you get into if time and money were not factors?
3888,General Response,"I would get further into skateboarding. Really skateboarding is all about having time and money. If you aren't very good, it just takes time, but good luck making any money skateboarding, that is a cutthroat business."
3889,prompt,What hobby would you get into if time and money were not factors?
3890,General Response,I would love to get into baking if money and time were not factors. I see some amazing and intricate desserts made and I would love to try and make them but some of the ingredients and tools needed to bake are expensive and baking requires a lot of time and patience.

3912,General Response,"It totally depends! I am a very social person but there aren't always friends available to go and play outside with. In those situations, I can always play online multiplayer games with friends to satisfy my social needs."

3914,General Response,"I prefer playing outside. I can get the exercise I need and see other people and nature. I'm at a computer all day, I would love to go outside."

3917,prompt,Would you rather lie to your parents or lie to your best friend?
3918,General Response,"I would rather lie to my best friend. I read a study about how people don't care about their friends more than their family, ever since that data and the arguments I read, it seems real. So, now I don't trust my friends as much as my family. We are hardwired that way."
3919,prompt,Would you rather lie to your parents or lie to your best friend?
3920,General Response,"Lie to your best friend, because lying to your parents would come with a bigger guilt that you would have to live with. A best friend could see past the lie and move on because she is your best friend."
3921,prompt,Would you rather lie to your parents or lie to your best friend?
3922,General Response,"I would rather lie to a best friend becuase friends come and go, while parents are forever and they provide for you."
3923,prompt,Would you rather lie to your parents or lie to your best friend?
3924,General Response,"It's so hard to lie to my parents but my best friend knows me better than they do. There's no I could lie to my best friend and get away with it. I guess I'd have to say I'd lie to my folks. Sorry, mom!"
3925,prompt,Would you rather marry someone who does not love you or marry someone you do not love?
3926,General Response,"Oh my, what a question.  A terrible choice; a real ""catch 22.""  I guess I'd rather marry someone I didn't love.  Being married to someone who didn't love me  is something I can't even imagine; that would be awful.  to marry someone I didn't love would be bad...real bad..but I think it would be a bit better than the alternative."
3927,prompt,Would you rather marry someone who does not love you or marry someone you do not love?
3928,General Response,"Oh, no... I wouldn't want to marry anybody who didn't love me! And I wouldn't want to marry someone I didn't love! But if this is a must answer kind of thing, I'm going to have to say that I would marry someone I didn't love. Think about it, if you marry someone who loves you and you live in happy, healthy, safe conditions, then there is at least a chance you will be okay. And, who knows, maybe I would learn to love that person."
3929,prompt,Would you rather marry someone who does not love you or marry someone you do not love?
3930,General Response,Marry someone I don't love would probably be easier for me as a person to deal with. If you married someone who didn't love you I feel like it would be a constant worry to try and make them or you constantly doubting yourself and trying to make up excuses as to why they don't love you and how they could. At least if you are the one who is not in love it's something you could deal with yourself. It's an internal issue that you could deal with and process on your own. Rather then having to constantly ask yourself why someone else doesn't feel like you do.
3931,prompt,Would you rather marry someone who does not love you or marry someone you do not love?
3932,General Response,I would rather marry someone who does not love me. I guess it wouldnt hurt as much if I was the one who was not loved.
3933,prompt,Would you rather marry someone who does not love you or marry someone you do not love?
3934,General Response,"With those choices, I would rather marry someone who I do not love, because affection can develop over time so there is a chance I would grow to love him as mush as he loved me."
3935,prompt,Would you rather always have to skip everywhere or run everywhere?
3936,General Response,"I'd rather run everywhere. Skipping is fun when you are a child, but its awkward looking as an adult."
3937,prompt,Would you rather always have to skip everywhere or run everywhere?
3938,General Response,"I guess if I had to pick I would rather skip everywhere because, to be honest run is not in my vocabulary.  Plus, if you run everywhere you miss so much."
3939,prompt,Would you rather always have to skip everywhere or run everywhere?
3940,General Response,"I would rather skip everywhere I think, mostly because I hate running."
3941,prompt,Would you rather always have to skip everywhere or run everywhere?
3942,General Response,"I would prefer to run everywhere. Running is great exercise for the body so I will stay fit regardless of what I eat daily. Also, I would save a lot of time since I am getting to places much faster"
3943,prompt,Would you rather always have to skip everywhere or run everywhere?
3944,General Response,"I'd rather run everywhere. I would get some good exercise and if I was skipping everywhere, I'd probably have a lot of explaining to do."
3945,prompt,Would you rather look strong and be weak or look weak and be strong?
3946,General Response,I would rather look weak and be strong because then people would have the expectations of me.
3947,prompt,Would you rather look strong and be weak or look weak and be strong?
3948,General Response,I would rather look weak and be strong. That means there will be an element of surprise if someone tries to mess with me.
3949,prompt,Would you rather look strong and be weak or look weak and be strong?
3950,General Response,"I'd definitely rather look weak and be strong. Then nobody will see it coming. if somebody ever picked a fight with you they would assume that you'd be so easy to beat, and then BAM, you prove them wrong. Everybody will be so amazed with how strong you are. I think even if I had the choice to look strong and be strong, I'd still rather look weak."
3951,prompt,Would you rather look strong and be weak or look weak and be strong?
3952,General Response,"I would want to look weak and be strong, that way I could surprise my attacker! It would make a cool party trick too!"
3953,prompt,Would you rather look strong and be weak or look weak and be strong?
3954,General Response,Id rather look strong. Appearance is everything and even if your weak inside no one will know if you give a strong appearance and it can make you stronger on the inside

3958,General Response,"Seasonal vacations were not taken, there was never a set time each year for vacations so they happened at different times."

3960,General Response,"Yes, when I was younger my parents use to take us on summer vacations every year. My favorite trip was Disney World."
3961,prompt,Did your family take seasonal vacations?
3962,General Response,Our family took seasonal vacations to the beach on occasion and had a lot of fun.
3963,prompt,Did your family take seasonal vacations?
3964,General Response,"Growing up, every year my family would go to Florida for a month in the winter.  We would of course do all the theme parks but also explored the area, it was a lot of fun that I will always cherish."
3965,prompt,Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction books?
3966,General Response,I prefer fiction books because it is a form of escapism. Fiction books allow you to explore fantasy worlds that you otherwise wouldn't have access too.
3967,prompt,Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction books?
3968,General Response,"I always studied science a lot while in college, so I was into nonfiction books. I usually prefer books that are realistic."
3969,prompt,Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction books?
3970,General Response,I prefer fiction because I can get lost in the story. It helps to take my mind off things.
3971,prompt,Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction books?
3972,General Response,I prefer fiction books to nonfiction because fiction usually packs more entertainment value than nonfiction
3973,prompt,Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction books?
3974,General Response,I prefer nonfiction books because I feel like my time is better spent trying to learn something than imagine a fake scenario.
3975,prompt,How often do you curse?
3976,General Response,"How often I curse depends entirely on the situation and who I'm around. I rarely curse around adult relatives and never around children, but I curse fairly frequently around friends and my brother."
3977,prompt,How often do you curse?
3978,General Response,"I rarely curse, and when I do it's most likely just for comedic purposes. I'm proud to have a fairly extensive vocabulary that narrowly borders on pedantic. If I were to insult someone, I'd most likely refer to them as some type of monosyllabic, troglodytic sycophant that smells of bacon. And not the good kind of bacon, mind you, but rather the greenish, bubbly shreds of pseudo swine flesh you'd find amidst the past-prime detritus surrounding the nearest Burger King dumpster. If I happen to become angry I do not speak at all, and that's more terrifying to anyone who knows me well enough to avoid the daggers lancing from my eyes."
3979,prompt,How often do you curse?
3980,General Response,"Probably too often! I curse like a saylor and I don't know how I ever staryed because I didn't hear much profanity growing up. I guess maybe that's why, making up for losg time!"
3981,prompt,How often do you curse?
3982,General Response,"More than I care to admit. My fiancee is always telling me to not curse so much. I have cut back a lot, but still do more than I don't."
3983,prompt,How often do you curse?
3984,General Response,"I curse all of the time, I am horrible at controlling it.  This is not a good thing because my older 2 boys have picked up on it and I am dreading them starting school."
3985,prompt,Would you rather have a terrible short-term memory or forget everything bad that ever happened to you?
3986,General Response,I would rather have terrible short-term memory because the bad memories are the ones that are most important to me.
3987,prompt,Would you rather have a terrible short-term memory or forget everything bad that ever happened to you?
3988,General Response,I'd rather forget everything bad that ever happened to me that way I can keep trying even when I fail.
3989,prompt,Would you rather have a terrible short-term memory or forget everything bad that ever happened to you?
3990,General Response,"I would rather have a terrible short term memory because, you can always right stuff down. I would not want to forget everything bad or I might make the same mistakes again!"
3991,prompt,Would you rather have a terrible short-term memory or forget everything bad that ever happened to you?
3992,General Response,"I would rather forget everything bad that has happened to me than have a terrible short term memory.  Sometimes in life it's the bad memories that can haunt you. So, if I had the choice, I'd rather forget the bad stuff."
3993,prompt,Would you rather have a terrible short-term memory or forget everything bad that ever happened to you?
3994,General Response,"I already have terrible short-term memory! I think, if giving up all of the bad memories would fix that issue, I would probably stick with having a terrible short-term memory. I can deal with that, but forgetting all of the bad would make some of the good that came after the bad less special."
3995,prompt,Would you rather be an actor/actress in a movie or in a television show?
3996,General Response,I'd rather be in a TV show because it would be more work in the end but I'd have fewer lines to memorize at a time.
3997,prompt,Would you rather be an actor/actress in a movie or in a television show?
3998,General Response,Would rather be an actor in a television show because there would potentially be a longer contract for a higher salary.
3999,prompt,Would you rather be an actor/actress in a movie or in a television show?
4000,General Response,I think I would rather be in a television show because it's a continuous thing. You get to play out different scenarios on different days and you get to really get to know your character rather than just one story like in a movie!
4001,prompt,Would you rather be an actor/actress in a movie or in a television show?
4002,General Response,"I would rather be an actress in a television show than in a movie. While a movie would be a job where you finish the job and you're done, a television show has the potential to go on for years and could be a more steady income coming in. With a large family like ours (four children), it's important to have a steady income."
4003,prompt,Would you rather be an actor/actress in a movie or in a television show?
4004,General Response,I would rather be an actor in a movie because I would be paid more. And not have to do too much work.

4007,prompt,What is the best / worst thing about your work / school?
4008,General Response,"I love the fact that most of my co-workers are really like family and there is a bond. On the flip side, I sometimes feel like the closeness means that there is a lack of privacy."
4009,prompt,What is the best / worst thing about your work / school?
4010,General Response,The best thing about my work is that I work from home.  I don't have any commute at all.  The worst thing is not socializing and it can sometimes be isolating to work from home.
4011,prompt,What is the best / worst thing about your work / school?
4012,General Response,My job pays me a lot for what I consider a stress free and low workloads and it is close to home.
4013,prompt,What is the best / worst thing about your work / school?
4014,General Response,The best thing about my work is that I get to start new orders for my team.
4015,prompt,What cartoons did you watch as a child?
4016,General Response,Wow; I watched many.  keep in mind I'm 61 so I was watching cartoons many years ago.  I loved the Flintstones.  I really liked Deputy Dawg.  And I clearly remember coming home from school and watching Dick Tracy on television.  Good memories.
4017,prompt,What cartoons did you watch as a child?
4018,General Response,"I watched the Smurfs, the snorks, Looney toons, flintstones, jetsons, banarama, popeye ."
4019,prompt,What cartoons did you watch as a child?
4020,General Response,"I don't recall watching too many cartoons as a child because we didn't get our first television until I was thirteen years old and by then, I was past the age to watch cartoons. I do remember seeing Felix the Cat a couple of times when I stayed overnight with friends but that's the only cartoon I recall from my childhood."
4021,prompt,What cartoons did you watch as a child?
4022,General Response,I loved watching Tom & Jerry as a kid. I always loved animals and for a short time believed the cartoons were real.
4023,prompt,What cartoons did you watch as a child?
4024,General Response,"When I was a child I pretty much watched anything that was on Saturday morning, but my favorite was Power Rangers.  Watching those old episodes now, I have to wonder what was I thinking."
4025,prompt,"Would you rather never eat your favorite food for the rest of your life, or only be able to eat your favorite food?"
4026,General Response,"I would rather never be about to eat my favorite food--I think if I only ate it, I would soon grow to hate it."
4027,prompt,"Would you rather never eat your favorite food for the rest of your life, or only be able to eat your favorite food?"
4028,General Response,I would rather to not eat my favorite food because if I was only able to eat my favorite food that would limit my diet
4029,prompt,"Would you rather never eat your favorite food for the rest of your life, or only be able to eat your favorite food?"
4030,General Response,I would rather never eat my favorite food because good diets require some sort of variety.
4031,prompt,"Would you rather never eat your favorite food for the rest of your life, or only be able to eat your favorite food?"
4032,General Response,I would rather never be able to eat my favorite food again then to have to eat nothing but that.  I need a little variety in my life and I am sure I could find a new favorite.
4033,prompt,"Would you rather never eat your favorite food for the rest of your life, or only be able to eat your favorite food?"
4034,General Response,"I would rather be able to eat my favorite food for the rest of my life. To eat food that you love is apart of enjoying and living your life. To have food that is not your favorite, you may want to eat less, and think not to eat as often."
4035,prompt,Would you rather be feared than loved?
4036,General Response,"No, because being loved is always better than feared. When you love someone they will try harder to not hurt you rather than to push you away so they dont get scared"
4037,prompt,Would you rather be feared than loved?
4038,General Response,"Not a chance. My daughter means the world to me, and until she was born I had never experienced pure, unconditional love. I've achieved the rank of Rokudan in kendo, and have black belts in jiu jitsu, judo, and aikido, so in a manner of speaking I suppose you could say I've been feared, as I've attended many tournaments and sparred in numerous matches. Still, I would choose to be loved over feared any day."
4039,prompt,Would you rather be feared than loved?
4040,General Response,"Absolutely not. I think being loved is one of the most valuable experiences in life. Being feared commands respect, and can generate power, but it does not complete a person."
4041,prompt,Would you rather be feared than loved?
4042,General Response,Feared as love is fleeting. Fear will stick to a person if properly deployed.
4043,prompt,Would you rather be feared than loved?
4044,General Response,I would much rather be loved. It is against human nature to prefer fear. I think that is a sign of a psychosis. Humans gravitate towards others instinctively.
4045,prompt,"If you were a king / queen, what would your throne look like?"
4046,General Response,"It would be soft, with lots of pillows and it would recline into a bed. I don't need it to be fancy, I would just want it to be comfortable! Queens can take naps whenever they want, right?"
4047,prompt,"If you were a king / queen, what would your throne look like?"
4048,General Response,My throne would be plush and comfortable with soft fabric. It would have turquoise fabric.
4049,prompt,"If you were a king / queen, what would your throne look like?"

4051,prompt,"If you were a king / queen, what would your throne look like?"
4052,General Response,"My throne would be purple and gold, like most thrones used to be, but the material would be the softest material my servants could find me."
4053,prompt,"If you were a king / queen, what would your throne look like?"
4054,General Response,"If I had a throne, it would be made out of the most fluffy and expensive materials."
4055,prompt,Where is the weirdest place you have seen someone you know?
4056,General Response,"Living in Florida, I was saw students of mine in Paris. While we did not talk, we waved in shock at seeing each other in a foreign country. The experience was odd."
4057,prompt,Where is the weirdest place you have seen someone you know?
4058,General Response,"The weirdest place I have ever seen someone I know would have to be 11 hours from home at a restaurant in Indiana. It seemed ironic to me that the two of us were there at the same time, 11 hours from where we both live."
4059,prompt,Where is the weirdest place you have seen someone you know?
4060,General Response,The weirdest place that I have seen someone that I know was on the train because it was always awkward.
4061,prompt,Where is the weirdest place you have seen someone you know?
4062,General Response,At the beach in a totally different state which was really weird and it wasnt even someone I personally really knew outside of high school but she seemed to think I did.
4063,prompt,Where is the weirdest place you have seen someone you know?
4064,General Response,The weirdest place I have seen someone was when I was at work and my mother's doctor came in not knowing I worked there and he lived 3000 miles away.
4065,prompt,What word or saying from the past do you think should come back?

4075,prompt,Would you rather have your first child when you are 18 years old or when you are 40 years old?
4076,General Response,"That's one of the more interesting questions I've been asked.  There are disadvantages in either case, but I'd prefer having my first child at the age of 40.  I realize that's kind of old to become a parent.  But by 40, I would have learned a lot about many things and I'd be able to pass on that knowledge to my child.  I just think that 18 is too young to become a parent.  I know it can be done, and there are some great 18 year old parents.  But too many things can go wrong."
4077,prompt,Would you rather have your first child when you are 18 years old or when you are 40 years old?
4078,General Response,"As someone who had their first child at the ripe old age of 21, I can definitely say I'd rather have my first child at 18. By the time you're 40, they're only 22. You're still young when they're going off to college, so I definitely think it's the right choice."
4079,prompt,Would you rather have your first child when you are 18 years old or when you are 40 years old?
4080,General Response,I would rather have my first child when I am 40 because I would be in a better position to take care of it.
4081,prompt,Would you rather have your first child when you are 18 years old or when you are 40 years old?
4082,General Response,Having a child when you're younger is definitely the better choice! I had my first when I was 22 and I can't imagine having one at 40. How old would you be when your child was 18 and leaving the house?
4083,prompt,Would you rather have your first child when you are 18 years old or when you are 40 years old?
4084,General Response,"I would rather have my first child at 40 because I think it is difficult to fully care for a child when you are barely an adult yourself.  If I had had a child when I was 18, I would have missed out on things I did back then, like going to college and other things that helped me to develop into a responsible adult."
4085,prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Alien or Predator?"
4086,General Response,Alien would win because they have special powers we cannot understand at this time.

4096,General Response,The most cliche things I have done in my life are saying a lot of cliche quotes
4097,prompt,What is the most cliche thing you have done in your life?
4098,General Response,"It was back in the Eighties, I guess.  I bought some of those ridiculous fashions of the day, and put stuff in my hair to try and be cool.  So silly!"
4099,prompt,What is the most cliche thing you have done in your life?
4100,General Response,"That I believe is live a dull life, since most people have done it, and it is somewhat painful."
4101,prompt,What is the most cliche thing you have done in your life?

4106,General Response,Yes!  I love to ride my bike all the time when the weather will allow me too!  It is great exercise and also a good way to take in all the scenery of a new place.  I enjoy the wind in my face and that feeling of being free.  It is a hobby I will always enjoy till the end.
4107,prompt,Do you like riding your bicycle? Why or why not?
4108,General Response,"I don't have a bicycle anymore, but I ride my son's bike sometimes. I really need to get bike I think...I've been running a lot lately and switching it up with biking would probably be a good idea."
4109,prompt,Do you like riding your bicycle? Why or why not?
4110,General Response,"I don't like riding a bicycle because I never learned as a child and so I am not good at it. I tried to learn as an adult and even though I managed to learn how to keep my balance after a few hours of practice, I still feel very insecure on one."
4111,prompt,Do you like riding your bicycle? Why or why not?
4112,General Response,"I haven't been on a bike since I was a kid, but I used to love riding to places before I could drive. Now it seems like a lot of work."
4113,prompt,Do you like riding your bicycle? Why or why not?
4114,General Response,"No, I do not like riding my bicycle anymore. I have back issues and riding my bike seems to make it worse."
4115,prompt,Do you have any pets? Why? Or why not?
4116,General Response,"I don't have pets because eventually they die, so why get attached to something that costs money if it won't ever give you a return and only make you feel sad."
4117,prompt,Do you have any pets? Why? Or why not?
4118,General Response,"We have an aquarium with saltwater fish.  We enjoy the hobby of caring for and watching the fish. It is a lot more work and expense that we originally expected, but now that we are so invested, there's no turning back."

4122,General Response,"I have three cats because I love kitties, but I was only supposed to have two, my husband said three would be too much. But the third was a rescue, actually the other two are too, but anyway it really needed a good home. And cats are so much easier than dogs...all ya have to do is feed them and clean the litter box!"
4123,prompt,Do you have any pets? Why? Or why not?
4124,General Response,I do not own any pets. The place i stay at i would have to put down a deposit and its a 200 deposit so i dont have the money for that.
4125,prompt,"Can you ride a horse? If not, do you want to learn?"
4126,General Response,"I was never able to learn to ride a horse, but I would love to learn. It seems like a very freeing experience."
4127,prompt,"Can you ride a horse? If not, do you want to learn?"
4128,General Response,"I cannot ride a horse, but it would nice to learn how to ride one. You never know when you'll be stranded at a ranch with no car during an apocalypse."
4129,prompt,"Can you ride a horse? If not, do you want to learn?"
4130,General Response,"I rode on a horse a few times in my youth, I think it's a good skill that everyone should have or at least experience a few times."
4131,prompt,"Can you ride a horse? If not, do you want to learn?"
4132,General Response,"I have never ridden a horse, but I would love to learn.  I would just need a really good teacher, because I might be afraid if I got so close to a big animal."
4133,prompt,"Can you ride a horse? If not, do you want to learn?"
4134,General Response,"No, I can't ride a horse, I have been on one before, but it's kind of scary sitting up so high."
4135,prompt,What apps have changed your life a lot?
4136,General Response,"Scanner Radio has changed my life a lot.  It's from Broadcastify.  I listen to it, especially during the winter, to find out about road conditions before leaving for work.

It's amazing! The Apple Health app keeps track of my exercise, I am able to track my steps, how many miles I have walked/ran, and if I did any flights of stairs or not!"
4141,prompt,What apps have changed your life a lot?
4142,General Response,"Scanable is the first one that comes to mind. Last year we about a house and along with that come a ton of paperwork, copies that need to be sent, things that need signed and sent again. Scanable made the process so much easier. The app scans each page of a document, cleans it up, and either saves or shares it. I could send everything to the bank or our agent in a matter of minutes right from my gmail."
4143,prompt,What apps have changed your life a lot?
4144,General Response,The App ESPN has changed my life a lot because it has helped me stop watching so much sports by just getting alert notifications to my phone.
4145,prompt,Would you rather be stranded on an island with someone you hate or stranded on an island alone?

4147,prompt,Would you rather be stranded on an island with someone you hate or stranded on an island alone?
4148,General Response,I would rather be stranded on the island alone. More resources for me and nobody to slow down my attempts at rescue!
4149,prompt,Would you rather be stranded on an island with someone you hate or stranded on an island alone?
4150,General Response,"I'd rather be stranded on an island with someone I hate. I can learn to like someone, and there isn't anyone I can't at least tolerate. Plus, with someone else there, I'll have someone to talk to and we could work together to get home. Another plus, if I hate them then I get to watch them suffer too."
4151,prompt,Would you rather be stranded on an island with someone you hate or stranded on an island alone?
4152,General Response,I would rather be stranded on an island alone because I would not want to have to take care of someone that I don't like.
4153,prompt,Would you rather be stranded on an island with someone you hate or stranded on an island alone?
4154,General Response,"I would be stranded on an island with someone I hate because I think my chance of survival would be better if I wasn't alone.  You never know, we might actually begin to like one another after a while."
4155,prompt,"Would you rather have a very muscular lower body and a normal upper body, or a muscular upper body but a very skinny lower body?"

4157,prompt,"Would you rather have a very muscular lower body and a normal upper body, or a muscular upper body but a very skinny lower body?"
4158,General Response,I think I would rather have a skinny lower body since I have struggled with large legs all my life and the diets just dont work for me
4159,prompt,"Would you rather have a very muscular lower body and a normal upper body, or a muscular upper body but a very skinny lower body?"
4160,General Response,"I would rather have a muscular upper body than a muscular lower body. I am always doing things like lifting and reaching. I am also rather flat-chested, so some padding behind there would help me fill out tops nicely. Bumpy legs are rather unsightly in my opinion. I would imagine they would be a pain to shave!"
4161,prompt,"Would you rather have a very muscular lower body and a normal upper body, or a muscular upper body but a very skinny lower body?"
4162,General Response,A strong upper body and a skinny lower body because I have a bad leg and the weight loss and being skinny would lessen my pain and the stronger arms could be useful in excerzing since I am limited by what i can do with lower bod with leg and back pain.
4163,prompt,"Would you rather have a very muscular lower body and a normal upper body, or a muscular upper body but a very skinny lower body?"
4164,General Response,I'd rather have a muscular upper body because having strong arms and shoulders and chest would help me do physical chores more easily

4171,prompt,Would you rather be able to sing like diva or be able to play the guitar like a rock star?
4172,General Response,I would rather be able to sing. Singers stand out much more than guitar players who can easily be replaced if needed. When is singer is changed the whole sound of a group can change as well. I'm much more likely to be known being a singer if I ever made it big in the music industry.
4173,prompt,Would you rather be able to sing like diva or be able to play the guitar like a rock star?
4174,General Response,"Playing an instrument give one more career options. You could take that talent and teach it to others, thus get paid to be a music teacher or tutor. Singing is very market oriented. Talent in singing is not the sole driver of success. There is a lot of balance that one loses if they choose to enter that sphere."
4175,prompt,What is your favorite thing to do on the weekend?
4176,General Response,"On the weekend, I like to really get out and explore the outdoors. I like to hike, canoe and backpack. If I can't, like if I'm sick, I'll stay in and watch movies."

4179,prompt,What is your favorite thing to do on the weekend?
4180,General Response,"Funnily enough, my favorite thing to do on the weekend is nothing. The weekend allows me to recharge my batteries so to speak."
4181,prompt,What is your favorite thing to do on the weekend?
4182,General Response,"My favorite thing to do on the weekend is rest and binge watch my favorite TV shows.  Lately, I am finding that I have seen so many of the shows available on demand, that it is becoming difficult to find new shows that I want to see."
4183,prompt,What is your favorite thing to do on the weekend?
4184,General Response,"First things first, relax a little. And then, of course hang out with my kids and husband...my hubby and I both work two jobs during the week we have to catch on family time as much as we can on the weekends."
4185,prompt,Would you rather be famous for your dancing or famous for your singing?

4188,General Response,I'd rather be famous for my singing because I already enjoy doing it and do it often.
4189,prompt,Would you rather be famous for your dancing or famous for your singing?
4190,General Response,"Since I am terrible at both of these things, I like this question. I'll go with dancing. Thanks to shows like The Voice and America's Got Talent, singing talent has become more and more prominent, or at least more people have become famous because of it. I think being famous for my dancing would make me more of a novelty, and I wouldn't mind being able to kill it at weddings."
4191,prompt,Would you rather be famous for your dancing or famous for your singing?
4192,General Response,That's a good one! I think I'd rather be famous for my dancing. I love to dance as a way to express myself but also because it makes me feel like I'm free without a care in the world but to feel good dancing to an amazing beat!
4193,prompt,Would you rather be famous for your dancing or famous for your singing?
4194,General Response,"I could potentially be famous for my singing, because I am classically trained to do so."
4195,prompt,What do you like to do in spring?

4197,prompt,What do you like to do in spring?
4198,General Response,"In spring, I like to look outside and look at the plants coming back to life and new flowers and leaves appearing."

4205,prompt,"If you had intro music, what song would it be? Why?"
4206,General Response,"My intro song would be ""Natural Woman"", because I just love that song.  I also consider myself to be a natural woman, as I don't have any plastic surgery and have almost no alterations to my natural appearance."
4207,prompt,"If you had intro music, what song would it be? Why?"
4208,General Response,"If I had to choose something, I think i'd pick the theme song to the original MacGyver TV series.  It starts off sort of analytical, then picks up as if a solution is found, then goes full-on music when the action starts."
4209,prompt,"If you had intro music, what song would it be? Why?"
4210,General Response,"My intro music would be ""Rockstar"" by Smashmouth. Because I'm a rockstar. No not really my intro music would be classical music because I am very fancy."
4211,prompt,"If you had intro music, what song would it be? Why?"
4212,General Response,"It would be a song by the band Thursday. I do not know what song, but that is my favorite band, so it makes sense that my intro music or theme song would be performed by them!"
4213,prompt,"If you had intro music, what song would it be? Why?"
4214,General Response,"my intro music would be ""A change is going to come.""  This let's everyone know that the world don't stand still for no one."
4215,prompt,Would you rather be as tall as you are wide or as wide as you are tall?
4216,General Response,I'd rather be tall as I am wide. Could you imagine how big doors and houses would have to be if everyone was as wide as they are tall?? Of course I'm not very wide which means stairs and driving would be really hard for me if I was only a foot-ish tall!
4217,prompt,Would you rather be as tall as you are wide or as wide as you are tall?
4218,General Response,Definitely as tall as wide. I don't wanna sit around and not enjoy life because I'm to big to get around anymore. I'd just be a little man!
4219,prompt,Would you rather be as tall as you are wide or as wide as you are tall?
4220,General Response,"Perhaps neither, but tall as you are wide at least seems to be in better proportions. As wide as you are tall, which almost sounds the same, at makes one seem larger, more obese."
4221,prompt,Would you rather be as tall as you are wide or as wide as you are tall?
4222,General Response,I'd probably want to be as wide as I am tall. The first option would make me pretty short.
4223,prompt,Would you rather be as tall as you are wide or as wide as you are tall?
4224,General Response,As tall as I am wide.  I amy small now and I meet both qualifications anyway!
4225,prompt,Would you rather have a pig nose or a monkey face?
4226,General Response,"A pig nose may be more fun than a monkey face, as being a ""pig-man"" was the subject of a Seinfeld TV show episode."
4227,prompt,Would you rather have a pig nose or a monkey face?
4228,General Response,I think I would rather have a pig face. At least then the rest of my face could be normal. I could even hide it like that girl in the movie Penelope. A monkey face would be so much harder to hide! Plus I think that would include fur and I don't need any more personal grooming to do.
4229,prompt,Would you rather have a pig nose or a monkey face?
4230,General Response,I would rather have a monkey face because pigs are so disgusting and have very ugly noses.
4231,prompt,Would you rather have a pig nose or a monkey face?
4232,General Response,"I would rather have monkey face because pigs are ugly, and at least some monkeys are cute."
4233,prompt,Would you rather have a pig nose or a monkey face?
4234,General Response,"I would rather have a monkey face. I think a pig nose could be annoying, and I'd rather have a face that looked incorrect for my species but put together than a patchwork looking face, even if most of it was normal."
4235,prompt,Would you rather be the star basketball player on your schools losing team or sit on the bench all season with your schools winning team?

4237,prompt,Would you rather be the star basketball player on your schools losing team or sit on the bench all season with your schools winning team?
4238,General Response,"Of course sit on the bench. I gotta let my team win and give them support. I mean come on, nobody likes a sore loser."
4239,prompt,Would you rather be the star basketball player on your schools losing team or sit on the bench all season with your schools winning team?
4240,General Response,"No doubt about it; I'd rather be the star player on a losing team.  I'd be very popular, my self-esteem would rise, and all in all I'd have a very good time.  sure, it would be frustrating to lose more than the team won.  but still, I'd get a lot of attention and I'd enjoy that.  Now let me say that the ideal situation would be to be an important player...not the star player...on a good team.  that way I'd get personal attention and enjoy winning.  but given the options you gave me, I'd prefer being the star on a losing team."
4241,prompt,Would you rather be the star basketball player on your schools losing team or sit on the bench all season with your schools winning team?
4242,General Response,I would rather sit on the bench of my school's winning team because I don't enjoy basketball very much.
4243,prompt,Would you rather be the star basketball player on your schools losing team or sit on the bench all season with your schools winning team?
4244,General Response,I would be happy sitting on the bench all season with the my schools winning team. I don't really like sports so I'd rather be on the sidelines than playing the game.
4245,prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Terminator, Robocop, or Alexa?"
4246,General Response,Alexa would definitely not win. That is just an app. It is silly to say it would win.
4247,prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Terminator, Robocop, or Alexa?"
4248,General Response,Terminator would win in a fight because he is from the future and has superior defense and weaponry.
4249,prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Terminator, Robocop, or Alexa?"
4250,General Response,I think Robocop would win the fight because he is programmed to sense crime.
4251,prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Terminator, Robocop, or Alexa?"
4252,General Response,Alexa! She'd wrap the other two completely around her finger and win that way for sure.
4253,prompt,"Who would win in a fight, Terminator, Robocop, or Alexa?"
4254,General Response,I think Alexa would win a fight with the Terminator and Robocop. Alexa has the capacity of the entire internet. This is more knowledge that both Robocop and Terminator. With this Alexa will surely outsmart the machines.
4255,prompt,Would you rather live around a noisy neighbor or a barking dog?
4256,General Response,"A barking dog. I can forgive the dog, it doesn't know how it affects people. But a noisy neighbor should know better."
4257,prompt,Would you rather live around a noisy neighbor or a barking dog?
4258,General Response,I would rather live around a noisy neighbor because they are more likely to be away from their home more often. Barking dogs are usually always at home.

4260,General Response,I would rather live around a barking dog. A nosy neighbor can start all sorts of drama and people are something else these days
4261,prompt,Would you rather live around a noisy neighbor or a barking dog?
4262,General Response,I would prefer to live around a barking dog than a noisy neighbor. It's because it might one day be possible to train a barking dog to stop barking at ungodly hours. But encountering a noisy neighbor every time might lead to altercations.
4263,prompt,Would you rather live around a noisy neighbor or a barking dog?
4264,General Response,A noisy neighbor. At least you can call the police on them or confront them about the noise.
4265,prompt,Would you rather not be allowed to wash your hands for a month or your hair for a month?
4266,General Response,"Given the choice between not washing my hands and not washing my hair for a month I would choose to not wash my hair. There are many people who do not wash their hair , however not washing your hands is very unsanitary and you would end up sick."
4267,prompt,Would you rather not be allowed to wash your hands for a month or your hair for a month?
4268,General Response,I would rather be able to wash my hands for a month because your hands carry the most germs and I get sick to easily not to wash my hands.
4269,prompt,Would you rather not be allowed to wash your hands for a month or your hair for a month?
4270,General Response,"My hair, after a while your hair will automatically lose oil, where your hand you use for everything including eating!"
4271,prompt,Would you rather not be allowed to wash your hands for a month or your hair for a month?
4272,General Response,My hair would rather go than my hands. Hands being the bearer of disease and all that. I have recently become acquainted with dry shampoo and it has saved me when I didn't have time to tend to my hair. I would definitely stock up for that month and no one would be the wiser!
4273,prompt,Would you rather not be allowed to wash your hands for a month or your hair for a month?
4274,General Response,I dont wash my hands as is...

To make things worse, we had a long stopover in Minneapolis, so we went to the Mall of America, and walked through the room with all the rollercoasters and rides.

4431,prompt,Would you rather live life in a small submarine at the bottom of the sea or in a small space capsule in outer space?
4432,General Response,I would rather live in a small space capsule in outer space because the ocean freaks me out. I get really nervous and uncomfortable around sea creatures. Those at the bottom of the sea are especially creepy!

4445,prompt,Do movies have the same power as books to change the world?
4446,General Response,"I was reading somewhere that the movie industry made something like $38.6 billion dollars globally last year. And when you think about how many people it took to get a number like that, you've got to say that movies are having at least some impact on the world. But, I would have to argue that it takes a really special movie to have a deeply profound impact on the world just like it takes a special book."
4447,prompt,Do movies have the same power as books to change the world?
4448,General Response,"Specific movies do, yes. There are a number of movies that live up to the books they're based on, and can be just as powerful. A few examples? To Kill a Mockingbird is right on par with the book and just as moving. To Kill A Mockingbird is amazing in its own right, as the novel is told from the perspective of the Chief, while the movie follows Jack Nicholson's character. Personally, the first movie I saw in theaters was Star Wars, and not only did it change the face of cinema, it became the focal point for my life development."
4449,prompt,Do movies have the same power as books to change the world?
4450,General Response,"I don't think so, they are both powerful in their own way, one u can create a story and characters through imagination and the other does it for you do can more visualize and enjoy the story."
4451,prompt,Do movies have the same power as books to change the world?
4452,General Response,Most people don't really read anymore so I think movies may actually have a greater impact in the world. I still read at least a dozen books a year. What about you?
4453,prompt,Do movies have the same power as books to change the world?
4454,General Response,"Hmmm...I think it depends on your perspective.  As a librarian, I would say books have more power.  However, my best friend is a big movie buff and she gets more and is motivated more by movies.  We argue about this all the time.  I think that books go more in depth...she feels that she knows the characters better by seeing how they are portrayed on screen."
4455,prompt,"You find a remote that can rewind, fast forward, stop and start time. What do you do with it?"

4457,prompt,"You find a remote that can rewind, fast forward, stop and start time. What do you do with it?"
4458,General Response,"I would destroy it because humans are not meant to manipulate time. I have seen the movie ""Click""."
4459,prompt,"You find a remote that can rewind, fast forward, stop and start time. What do you do with it?"

4461,prompt,"You find a remote that can rewind, fast forward, stop and start time. What do you do with it?"
4462,General Response,"If I found a magical time machine remote, I'd first rewind, and go back to all my favorite memories and watch them. Next, I'd fast forward and check out the future. I'd probably go to multiple dates in the future just to see how much things change. I don't think I'd use the start or stop buttons, but a pause or mute button would be a nice addition to the remote!"
4463,prompt,"You find a remote that can rewind, fast forward, stop and start time. What do you do with it?"
4464,General Response,"I rewind to the past and murder every horrible dictator while time was paused, and I do the same for all atrocities, then I fast forward to the future and enjoy their technology."

4467,prompt,Do you experience phantom vibration? (Feeling your phone vibrate even though it did not.)
4468,General Response,"Yes, I experience that all the time and it drives me insane. Sometimes i'm not sure if it's because i'm anticipating a call and it's just my mind playing tricks on me or if I've just become that dependent on it and I cant help but be separated from it."
4469,prompt,Do you experience phantom vibration? (Feeling your phone vibrate even though it did not.)

4473,prompt,Do you experience phantom vibration? (Feeling your phone vibrate even though it did not.)
4474,General Response,"I have experienced phantom vibration in the past but I do not anymore, maybe because people don't call or text me as much as they used to."
4475,prompt,Do you always have to have the latest phone?
4476,General Response,"No. I am typically content with what I have until I lose it, break it, or otherwise. When that happens, I make a balanced decision between what's new and what's a good deal financially."

4478,General Response,"No. I am not interested in the ""latest and greatest"", I just want a phone that does what I need it to without any issues."
4479,prompt,Do you always have to have the latest phone?
4480,General Response,"I don't always have to have the LATEST phone, but I like to have a RECENT phone so I am not too much out of the loop."
4481,prompt,Do you always have to have the latest phone?
4482,General Response,Not at all--I love my iPhone 4 because its battery is built like a tank. My friends don't get anywhere near as far as I do on a charge.
4483,prompt,Do you always have to have the latest phone?
4484,General Response,I like to have the latest phone but I do admit that I am not one of the first to purchase it. I like to wait awhile to make sure there are no widespread bugs before committing to a new phone.

4489,prompt,What is the most laid back job you have ever had?
4490,General Response,"the most laid back job I've ever had is the job I have now.  I'm 61 years old and believe me, I've had many  jobs.  this job is so laid back; it's actually too laid back.  I wish I had more to do.  there's  a lot of free time; it's really boring.  it certainly is laid back; just the opposite of the many hectic jobs I've had during my 38 years on the work force."
4491,prompt,What is the most laid back job you have ever had?
4492,General Response,"When I was a senior in high school I worked at a water park in Palm Springs, California where I was a lifeguard. I had to be alert and yes at times I was needed for issues, but for the most part I just sat back and got paid to get a tan and go in the water."
4493,prompt,What is the most laid back job you have ever had?

4496,General Response,"I grew up with tapes, CDs, and MP3s. Tapes are good because you can record over them when a stereo system. But not easily copy them to a computer file. CDs give great quality, but if mishandled then they can skip when played. MP3s are the best. You can save the files, upload them, transfer them, splice them, etc... Good quality most of the time."
4497,prompt,"Records, tapes, CDs, MP3s. Which did you grow up with? What is good and bad about each?"
4498,General Response,"I grew up with records, tapes and CD.  Records and CD's are fragile,  but still sound the best and tapes can melt and break."
4499,prompt,"Records, tapes, CDs, MP3s. Which did you grow up with? What is good and bad about each?"
4500,General Response,"I grew up with them all, obviously records and tapes were analog so was fiddly and require lots of manual maneuvering. CDs and MP3s were digital and was easier to control to get what you want faster."
4501,prompt,"Records, tapes, CDs, MP3s. Which did you grow up with? What is good and bad about each?"
4502,General Response,"records are classy because they are vintage but the sound quality isnt that great. CDs are convenient because you can play them almost anywhere, but they are fragile. MP3s store lots of music, but if you want to share your music with other people you typically need a seperate device"
4503,prompt,"Records, tapes, CDs, MP3s. Which did you grow up with? What is good and bad about each?"
4504,General Response,I grew up with CD's and they were not very good. CD's are limited to the amount of music you can play on them. I prefer devices which have the capacity to hold many more songs that will fit my daily moods.

4509,prompt,Would you rather never touch an electronic device again or never touch a human again?
4510,General Response,"I'd be exceedingly comfortable never touching an electronic device again. I have a secluded cabin in the middle of nowhere just outside Denver, Colorado, and venture into the solitude for weeks at a time as often as I can. Of course there's electricity and a landline telephone, but there is no television, no XBox, no internet, and absolutely, unequivocally no mention of Donald Trump whatsoever."
4511,prompt,Would you rather never touch an electronic device again or never touch a human again?
4512,General Response,"Never again an electric device, absolutely! You must be joking.  How miserable and lonely to never feel human touch. No electric would be inconvenient, but really."
4513,prompt,Would you rather never touch an electronic device again or never touch a human again?
4514,General Response,I'd rather never touch an electronic device again because for them you can use voice commands and even ask someone to operate them for you.

In my dream somehow I wasn't Cinderella, but I wasn't a step sister.

4519,prompt,What did you dream about last night?
4520,General Response,"Last night I dreamed that a friend and I were forced to do something illegal and we were afraid that we would be arrested. I don't remember the other details, but it felt so real.  I was so glad to wake up to my actual reality!"

4523,prompt,What did you dream about last night?
4524,General Response,I didn't have any dreams last night. I don't sleep long enough to dream. I think the last dream I had was a few weeks ago and it was that we traveled to France to go up the Eiffel Tower.
4525,prompt,What is something you just have to do every day?

4535,prompt,Would you rather lose your sense of taste or your sense of smell?
4536,General Response,"I would rather lose my sense of taste. Since taste and smell are connected, losing my sense of smell would also damage my sense of taste. At least by keeping my sense of smell I could enjoy the smells of my favorite foods, even if I could no longer taste them."
4537,prompt,Would you rather lose your sense of taste or your sense of smell?
4538,General Response,I would rather lose my sense of smell--I love good food too much to never taste it again.
4539,prompt,Would you rather lose your sense of taste or your sense of smell?
4540,General Response,I would much rather lose my sense of taste than my sense of smell. I really don't care for food that much so I don't think it would bother me that much. I have a really strong sense of smell and believe that losing it would dramatically effect me.

4542,General Response,I'd rather lose my sense of smell. I love tasting food too much and I can't bear to lose that.
4543,prompt,Would you rather lose your sense of taste or your sense of smell?

It's something my husband and I have actually discussed before."
4549,prompt,"If you opened a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?"

4553,prompt,"If you opened a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?"

4565,prompt,"If you could have any animal as a pet, what animal would you choose?"
4566,General Response,"I'd have a capybara. They're the world's largest rodent! I've had rats and hamsters and I absolutely loved them. If a capybara is as intelligent as a rat, it'd be just as fun as a rat but my cats wouldn't have to be as gentle."
4567,prompt,"If you could have any animal as a pet, what animal would you choose?"
4568,General Response,"I would choose no pets because they are a lot of work to take care of.  Also we like to travel, and when you have pets, that complicates travel plans."

4573,prompt,"If you could have any animal as a pet, what animal would you choose?"
4574,General Response,"If I could have any pet I would have a cat because I have had cats in the past and I really like them, and they are self sufficient, so if you're the kind of person who can't be home during the day to give them a walk they are fine."
4575,prompt,Do you think people read more or less books now than 50 years ago?
4576,General Response,I think people need to read more books now. I believe people are on social media to much.
4577,prompt,Do you think people read more or less books now than 50 years ago?
4578,General Response,"I think people read less books than 50 years ago.  They may read digital books, but movies are made of many of the good books and a lot of people will just go see the movie instead.  There are a lot more people reading online articles and blogs and things like that instead of books as well."
4579,prompt,Do you think people read more or less books now than 50 years ago?
4580,General Response,"I think people read less books just because there's less time. However now it's easy to get audio books, which is a great alternative."
4581,prompt,Do you think people read more or less books now than 50 years ago?
4582,General Response,People definitely read much less than they used to. I go to the library and it is depressing how empty it is and how few people are there to peruse the shelves. Shelves are also more empty than ever. They come to use the computer. Before people were forced to look through pages for information and now it is much more accessible without much thinking or pursuing.
4583,prompt,Do you think people read more or less books now than 50 years ago?
4584,General Response,"I think the instinctive answer is to say no. At first thought, we have so many other forms of entertainment that it seems that books are dying out. However, with e-readers becoming so popular and it being so easy to order a print book from online retailers, I think people are actually reading more than they did 50 years ago."

4605,prompt,Would you rather be famous for being extremely intelligent or for being good looking?

4607,prompt,Would you rather be famous for being extremely intelligent or for being good looking?
4608,General Response,I would rather be extremely intelligent than good looking because looks can  fade in a fraction of a second.
4609,prompt,Would you rather be famous for being extremely intelligent or for being good looking?
4610,General Response,"It would be really difficult to be famous for being extremely intelligent unless I was actually extremely intelligent, so I think it would be better to be famous for being good looking. At least there would be a lot less pressure for being pretty than smart."

4619,prompt,"What is the one thing you cannot do, no matter how hard you try?"
4620,General Response,"Draw. I'm so bad at drawing. I can't even draw a stupid fish. I have this really cool image in my head that I want to put on paper and show everyone what my brain did, but my hands don't want to cooperate."
4621,prompt,"What is the one thing you cannot do, no matter how hard you try?"
4622,General Response,"One thing I cannot do is tie my shoes in a way other than what I have been doing for the last 23 years.  People laugh and say I do it wrong, but I just can't figure out how to do it the ""right way""."
4623,prompt,"What is the one thing you cannot do, no matter how hard you try?"
4624,General Response,"I cannot tie my grocery bags the way they do at Asian stores. They quickly tie my bag into a ""knot but not a knot"" that is easy to pull apart, but tight enough to keep the groceries from spilling out of my car. No matter how hard I try, I cannot figure it out. I have tried youtube, my husband has tried to teach me. It is hard!"

4633,prompt,Which app has helped society the most? Which one has hurt society the most?
4634,General Response,I like the facebook app because I can connect with my friends and share recipes and see pictures of each others families and learn new ways of doing things. The faceook app has hurt society because people share things that are personal or share too many everyday things that we don't care about and also too much time is used looking at the app.

4710,General Response,"Well, hopefully I won't have anymore first dates, if you know what I mean! However, if I had to make this choice, starting over with a new relationship, I'd say something relaxed. I'd probably start with like, a fancy dinner in one of those restaurants with the dim lights so he doesn't see me stuffing my face full of delicious charcuteries. Then after dinner, maybe bowling or rock climbing. I'd love to see my date sweat! Plus it'd be important to break him in now to my active lifestyle, ya know? I'd hate to lead him on, thinking I'm okay with just sitting at home on the weekends watching tv all day."
4711,prompt,Where do you like to go on a first date?
4712,General Response,I'd like to go mini golfing on a first date so we're pre-occupied with a fun activity instead of trying to force a conversation. The mini golf could even give us stuff to tease each other and be playful about too.

4721,prompt,Would you rather lick the bottom of your shoe or eat your boogers?
4722,General Response,"Eat my own boogers. At least they came from my body, I would just be putting them back. The bottom of my shoe could have YOUR boogers on it."

4742,General Response,I think that any kind of chocolate balls look disgusting but they taste good. There's a lot of imagery that one could associate chocolate balls with so it's just hard for me I guess.
4743,prompt,What food looks disgusting but tastes delicious?
4744,General Response,"Goat brains both look and sound kind of gross, but the taste is amazing. It's one of my favorite things to eat."

4776,General Response,"Yes for sure! Traveling allows you to see how other people live and can give you a different perspective on their lives and how they work, eat and live. Traveling also introduces you to many different interesting (and delicious) cuisines."
4777,prompt,How do you think traveling to a lot of different countries changes a person?
4778,General Response,"I would think so. I mean it could make you more aware of the world in a personal way.

4794,General Response,"I'm not sure if you mean meal time or the actual meal so I'll answer both ways. 1.

Remember the dinner scene from Beetlejuice where everyone starts singing and dancing against their will?"
4795,prompt,What is your favorite genre of movie?

4822,General Response,"I would rather be unknown and forgotten, than famous and remembered with hatred. For the most part, I'm a loving person in my everyday life--I try to treat everyone with respect. What's the point of being famous, if you treat everyone worst than garbage."
4823,prompt,Would you rather be famous and remembered with hatred or unknown and forgotten?

4833,prompt,Would you rather always smell rotten meat or always smell skunk?
4834,General Response,"I would rather smell skunk. I'm from the country and even though they smell awful, it's not the same as rotting meat. Bad meat would make me gag."

4865,prompt,Would you rather be able to sleep as late as you wish or be able to stay up as late as you like?

4868,General Response,I hate to miss the beautiful mornings. I would much rather stay up as late as I could rather than sleep in. Late mornings feel like I have missed so much. There needs to be a break between breakfast and lunch. Just as simple as that. Late meals are so bad on our metabolism.

4873,prompt,Would you rather be able to sleep as late as you wish or be able to stay up as late as you like?
4874,General Response,"Honestly, I guess I'd have to say that the ability to sleep in is better. The thing is, when you stay up late, you already want to sleep in, so ultimately, probably sleeping in is more important."

Also the behavior challenges of children gets worse every year from the lack of discipline and parenting in childrens lives. Technology has made kids want everything instantly and they have no patience for pausing for a second or reading a book and become increasingly bored of tasks that do not have instant gratification or are not digital or tv based or internet based.

4942,General Response,"I'd have to know what's in the dog food first, and if it were high quality, that's definitely my choice. The bananas would give you the runs."
4943,prompt,Would you rather eat a small can of dog food or six overripe bananas?

4949,prompt,Was there ever an event in your life that defied explanation?
4950,General Response,"There was this one person I used to know that had lived a double life, and she had never told me about it.

I'll check online or google things too but if I have a friend or someone knows someone who had an experience somewhere, I'll always value their opinion.

I was pulled over nearly every time I left on an errand outside of our town when I first moved to the area. It has kept me on the straight and narrow ever since."
4973,prompt,"Do you drive the speed limit, or are you a speed demon?"

4996,General Response,"No doubt about it, I'd rather lose my sense of smell. let's face it, sometimes losing the sense of smell would actually be a good thing.

Losing my sense of taste would be awful."
4997,prompt,Would you rather lose your sense of smell or your sense of taste?
4998,General Response,"I would rather lose my sense of smell, that way you don't have to smell gross smells anymore."
4999,prompt,Would you rather lose your sense of smell or your sense of taste?
5000,General Response,"I guess I would rather loose my sense of smell than taste.  However, taste and smell are senses that are connected, so it would be hard to lose one without the other.  An example is how food tastes different when you have a stuffy nose and are sick."

5005,prompt,Would you rather wear a bathing suit or wear formal attire everywhere you go for the next two weeks?
5006,General Response,"I would rather wear bathing suits, because we live in the desert. It is incredibly hot around here. I actually have bathing suits that are merely shirts and shorts. I feel like its cheating, but there you go. It would be no problem to wear something like that. It would be different from my usual attire, because in the desert you should cover up rather than expose skin. It is safer overall health-wise than having to worry about sunscreen."
5007,prompt,Would you rather wear a bathing suit or wear formal attire everywhere you go for the next two weeks?

5013,prompt,Would you rather wear a bathing suit or wear formal attire everywhere you go for the next two weeks?

5016,General Response,"Nurses to change your sheets, warm meals, and exercise time. I can get that at both a nursing home and at a jail, so the tiebreaker for me would have to be Bingo. I don't think I would get much of that at the jail, so nursing home it is."
5017,prompt,Would you rather spend 2 months living in a nursing home or two months in jail?
5018,General Response,"As long as it's a good one, I'll take the nursing home any day of the week. The food would be better, there would bingo, and card games, and I could sleep as much I want! And I wouldn't fearing for my life, like I would if I was in the big house!"
5019,prompt,Would you rather spend 2 months living in a nursing home or two months in jail?
5020,General Response,"I would rather spend two months in a nursing home, because I worked in one. I am a realist and aging is a part of life that we all need to better get in touch with. I don't think incarceration is necessary something that we need to experience to make us better. I have acquaintances that work in the jail and have explained to me the realities of jails in America."
5021,prompt,Would you rather spend 2 months living in a nursing home or two months in jail?
5022,General Response,2 months living in a nursing home. I'd at least have freedom to move around and have friends to talk to. I don't know if you are allowed to move around and have friends in jail. Plus I hear the food is better in a nursing home!
5023,prompt,Would you rather spend 2 months living in a nursing home or two months in jail?
5024,General Response,I would rather spend 2 months living in a nursing home just because of the people I'd be living with would be better than those living in prison.

5026,General Response,I think I would 100% choose my boyfriend.  The reason I choose him over the celebrity is because I know that I will have a good time with him but with the celebrity I wouldn't know that.  I have read in a lot of magazines that a lot of celebrities are very cocky and standoffish.  Don't want to take the risk.
5027,prompt,Would you rather be locked inside an old building with your boyfriend/girlfriend or inside an amusement park with a celebrity?

5031,prompt,Would you rather be locked inside an old building with your boyfriend/girlfriend or inside an amusement park with a celebrity?
5032,General Response,"Wait, can I pick this celebrity? Just joking, I'd rather be locked inside an amusement park with a celebrity. I could ask them so many questions."
5033,prompt,Would you rather be locked inside an old building with your boyfriend/girlfriend or inside an amusement park with a celebrity?
5034,General Response,I would rather be locked inside an old building with my boyfriend--I don't usually enjoy amusement parks and an old building sounds neat.

5065,prompt,Who do you think are the greatest athletes of all time?
5066,General Response,"I believe the greatest athletes of all time first would be Dan Marino , for obvious reasons, the main one being he's in the hall of fame and not for his good looks. And secondly Joe Montana, because he was so dedicated to being ""Joe Montana"" he thrived at everything he attempted."
5067,prompt,Who do you think are the greatest athletes of all time?

5085,prompt,"If you had to get rid of a holiday, which would you get rid of? Why?"
5086,General Response,"If I had to get rid of a holiday I would get rid of New Year's Day. It seems to be a silly reason to get a day off work, a silly reason to get smashed. I would rather enjoy Christmas and then continue on to Valentine's Day."

It's not a major holiday, but it certainly is treated like one; at least by some people.  this is a holiday that most people treat as it should be treated...maybe have a little fun; treat it as it was intended.  but unfortunately there are some people who act like immature children just because it's ""April Fools day.""  they act like they can use the day as an excuse to act as a juvenile.  I can tell you from experience that some classmates said some very insensitive things to me, and thought it was all harmless just because it was ""april fools day.""  I'm 61 years old and still remember this."
5093,prompt,"If you had to get rid of a holiday, which would you get rid of? Why?"

5101,prompt,What TV show do you most identify with?

5103,prompt,What TV show do you most identify with?
5104,General Response,"I really identify with The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, because I was raised in a really weird cult-like environment and, like Kimmy, it can be both funny and dramatic trying to adapt to mainstream society."

5119,prompt,Would you rather break up with someone or have someone break up with you?
5120,General Response,"Wow, either one would be upsetting. I think I would rather break up with someone else, though. At least then I would be able to anticipate and prepare for the situation. If I was the one to be broken up with, I probably wouldn't see it coming. Then again, I guess then the other person would have to feel that way which sucks too."

5122,General Response,I would rather break up with someone because I have never done it before and want to know what it is like.

5124,General Response,"I would rather break up with someone. At least if I am breaking up with someone, I already know and it's not like a surprise, you know? I mean if they break up with me, I probably would not expect it and it would hurt a lot more."
5125,prompt,What is something that really annoys you but does not bother most people?

5129,prompt,What is something that really annoys you but does not bother most people?
5130,General Response,"I get really annoyed by all the absurd commercials on television.  I think they bother me more than most people; so many of the commercials these days just seem to be to be really silly; just plain juvenile.  if that makes me sound like a snob, I'm just being honest.  some of these commercials are unbearable to me.  however, once in a while there is a good commercial; I have to admit."
5131,prompt,What is something that really annoys you but does not bother most people?
5132,General Response,"Driving long distances really annoys me and every time I have to do I have a bad trip. Its usually only when I have to drive by myself and not with others. I know most people can just go with the flow realizing its not a big deal, but for me I always tend to get caught up in traffic jams, behind slow drivers, etc."
5133,prompt,What is something that really annoys you but does not bother most people?

5141,prompt,Would you rather live with someone you hate or live completely alone?
5142,General Response,"I'd rather live alone than with someone I hate. I wouldn't want to put myself, or even the person I hate, in a situation where I hate being in my own home, or feel uncomfortable with the other person there. I'd rather be lonely than miserable."
5143,prompt,Would you rather live with someone you hate or live completely alone?

And I couldn't stand to think what bodily fluids must have been sprayed all over the place. But the best hotel I've ever stayed at... huh... Well, I was still probably worried about bodily fluids. Just because it costs a lot and is all fancy doesn't mean people don't get up to all sorts of things!"

Once again, my family was traveling and we randomly came across this hotel (the two times we booked a hotel right on the spot ended up being the best and worst hotels.

These are restaurants that serve a light meal and tea but the real attraction is that you get to pet cats of all kinds.  The cats will come and sit around you at your table and you can pick them up, stroke them, or feed them.  Or, if you prefer, you can just enjoy watching them.  They have beds and play areas around the restaurant so you can enjoy seeing them, and there are different kinds of cats, calico and bobtail and longhaired Persian and Siamese, and lots of kittens."

5375,prompt,What is something that is popular now that annoys you?

5380,General Response,"far left wing news shows, as well as far right wing shows, annoy  me.  I'm referring to networks such as FOX-news and MSNBC.  they are so one sided that it's absurd.  these networks are part of the reason I consider myself a political moderate.  extreme political views scare me.  and many viewers to these shows, no doubt, are not interested in the truth...they just want to have their own one sided views validated.  very sad."
5381,prompt,What is something that is popular now that annoys you?
5382,General Response,The latest trend that has come on the market is Fidget Spinners.  I seriously DO NOT understand them AT ALL.  They were supposed to be used for people that have a lot of stress and anxiety in their lives but kids are just collecting them like baseball cards.  I don't understand what is the big deal.  I think it's a passing phase.

5444,General Response,The worst person to be stuck in the elevator with is anyone who I don't like.  The best person to be stuck with (presuming that we would be rescued and not die) is my sweetheart.  We would pass the time talking and entertaining each other.
5445,prompt,How much time do you spend at the gym or working out?

5484,General Response,Andy Griffith and the old classics are underrated because our values today in society are forgotten.  In 30 minutes this show and others like it show us plain decent human compassion and behavior.  The most overrated show is Keeping up with the Kardachians because these are just spoiled rich girls getting attention because of their nasty and spoiled ways.  They are getting rich just because they are on a show acting like bimbos.  We all deal with these same issues every day but these girls as I call them because real women with self respect wouldn't act that way are getting millions just because they are on tv and we want to watch the chaos.  If you like chaos so much just look out your back door!

5493,prompt,Would you rather exercise regularly or eat a healthy diet?
5494,General Response,I'd much rather exercise regularly. I have a crazy sweet tooth and cutting chocolate out of my diet would be torture. But I do think that eating healthy is way more important than exercising.

5513,prompt,What was your favorite restaurant when you were in university? How about when you were a child?
5514,General Response,At college my favorite restaurant was the local Pizza Hut. It was the only place open all night in my small college town. So my friends and I got in the habit of heading over there practically every night around midnight to share a pizza and shoot the bull for an hour or so before going to bed.  I don't recall any favorite restaurants from my childhood. Back then (way back in the fifties and early sixties) people didn't take their children out to restaurants very often.
5515,prompt,"Do you like reality TV shows? Why or why not? If so, which ones?"

Health issues are also interesting like shows where people need to lose or gain weight. Lifestyle issues that may affect others that they may encounter and help them empathize with others.

5528,General Response,"I would rather skip everywhere I go. It would be much easier on the joints and cleavage if I could skip rather than the more impactful option of jumping.

5598,General Response,"First, I'd need to know what powers I'd have.Whichever one allows me to fly, turn invisible, or walk through walls would be my choice. If I were a supervillian, I'd probably using my powers to terrorize my enemies or people who frustrate me in every day life.

5635,prompt,How do you plan to make the world a better place?
5636,General Response,I don't actively do that. But I do work hard to stay out of people's way and be non-aggressive. I am laid back and easygoing and I try to get others to view life the same way. I think that eases conflicts.

5644,General Response,"I think everyone on Earth is called to play their part in making the world a better place, and I hope to use my love of languages to connect with people.

5652,General Response,"Worse...oh my god...WORSE!  I read a minimum of four books to my kids every day and the new books have no plot, no rhythm, no structure.  It is like word vomit on color vomit and some idiot thought it should be published.  And don't even get me started on how dumbed down adult fiction is now.  REAL authors cannot even get their stuff published unless it can be read by adults reading on a 4th grade level.  It is ridiculous!"
5653,prompt,"Now that indie publishing has become easier, have books gotten better or worse?"
5654,General Response,Books have gotten better since indie publishing because it is a better avenue for free speech and people don't have to write what other people tell them.

5689,prompt,"Would you rather have $1,000,000 now or $5,000 a week for the rest of your life?"
5690,General Response,"I would prefer to have the $5,000 a week as with my current age it will likely be much more."
5691,prompt,"Would you rather have $1,000,000 now or $5,000 a week for the rest of your life?"
5692,General Response,"I would choose to have $5,000 a week for the rest of my life. The million dollars would go by too quickly and I would probably blow it on irresponsible things, at least with the 5k I would have a steady income."
5693,prompt,"Would you rather have $1,000,000 now or $5,000 a week for the rest of your life?"
5694,General Response,"5,000/week is 260,000/year. I plan on living over 4+ years so I could make 1,000,000 in 4 years and then keep on making money. Of course I don't know what I would do with that much money!"
5695,prompt,Would you rather live a long life in poverty or a short life with wealth?
5696,General Response,"I'd rather live a long life in poverty. A long life generally means decent health, and I've seen more happy, poor people than I have seen happy, wealthy people. Even if wealthy people surround themselves with people, most of them look so ubhappy and lonely."

5700,General Response,"I think I would want a short life with wealth...I don't want me and my family to be cold and hungry. So when I die, they could live on the riches I leave behind."
5701,prompt,Would you rather live a long life in poverty or a short life with wealth?
5702,General Response,I would choose poverty because I would live longer and learn more life lessons from this lifestyle. Also I would be able to enjoy the things I do have.
5703,prompt,Would you rather live a long life in poverty or a short life with wealth?
5704,General Response,I would obviously rather live a long life in poverty because at least I would have an option to rise out of poverty. Money is not everything!
5705,prompt,What holidays have been over commercialized?
5706,General Response,"I think that Thanksgiving has been extremely over commercialized. I feel like it's lost its entire meaning. It's become an excuse to eat a lot of food, watch football games, and clamor over anything supposedly containing pumpkin. Thanksgiving should be about reflection on your life and what really matters to you. It should also be a time to help those in need so they also have something to be thankful for."
5707,prompt,What holidays have been over commercialized?
5708,General Response,All holidays have been over commercialized. We as people have forgotten the true meaning of holidays. It's all about stuff now and not traditions and family.
5709,prompt,What holidays have been over commercialized?
5710,General Response,At the moment I do not feel as if any holidays have been over commercialized. They need to make more commercials to remind everyone of the holidays and get people motivated for them.
5711,prompt,What holidays have been over commercialized?
5712,General Response,I think Christmas is an extremely over commercialized holiday. Whenever I have friends talk about celebrating Christmas I'm always sure to ask them about what  church services they attend and whether they are going to be in the Christmas pageant etc.  After they give me funny looks I explain to them that I thought they meant that they were celebrating Mass for the birth of Christ and I'm a bit confused about their need to buy Santa Claus decorations.
5713,prompt,What holidays have been over commercialized?
5714,General Response,"Uh...Christmas...I mean, usually stores start putting up Christmas displays at the end of summer.  I would love to get a chance to celebrate Halloween BEFORE I have to start worrying over Christmas."
5715,prompt,What restaurant do you eat at most?

5721,prompt,What restaurant do you eat at most?
5722,General Response,I hate to admit it but we probably eat at Carl's Jr more than anywhere else. It's close by so very convenient and it's cheap. But most importantly Carl's Jr. make a darned good burger they will serve all their burgers wrapped in lettuce instead of on a bun which is really nice for those of us who eat low carb diets to control diabetes and weight.
5723,prompt,What restaurant do you eat at most?
5724,General Response,"Dominics 2, in Lake Worth. It's got the freshest pizza in South Florida, it actually tastes like real New York Style Pizza."

5729,prompt,Would you rather never have to brush your teeth again or never have to take a bathe again?
5730,General Response,Thats a hard decision.  I would have to go with never bathing again because I could always go outside on a rainy day with a bar of soap.
5731,prompt,Would you rather never have to brush your teeth again or never have to take a bathe again?
5732,General Response,"I'd like to never have to take a bath again. I don't love baths. I don't like to sit in filth and I don't find them relaxing at all. Showers are a daily necessity of course, but even those take too long. Brushing my teeth takes 3 minutes at most using my electric toothbrush. Much easier!"
5733,prompt,Would you rather never have to brush your teeth again or never have to take a bathe again?
5734,General Response,"I'd rather never have to brush my teeth again. Showers are more pleasurable, not just means of getting clean."
5735,prompt,Would you rather stay forever at your current age or be 10 years younger?
5736,General Response,I would be 10 years younger. The reason i say that is my body is falling apart and im more tired then i have ever been.

I mean who wants to be an adult for like forever. Wouldn't it be so awesome to be a teenager forever. Young energetic and spry. The world would totally be my play ground. And technically I wouldn't be an adult, so i wouldn't have all the burdens and annoyances that come with adult life."
5741,prompt,Would you rather stay forever at your current age or be 10 years younger?
5742,General Response,"Oh, I would definitely choose to stay 10 years younger, since I was in much better health then and much more active.  Having had chronic health problems and surgery during the past two years has worn me down quite a bit.  I don't know that I would want to be really young again, but yes, I would be happy to go back 10 years."
5743,prompt,Would you rather stay forever at your current age or be 10 years younger?
5744,General Response,I would rather stay my current age forever because I would like to see all the advancements in technology.

5753,prompt,What was your first smart phone? How did you feel when you got it?
5754,General Response,"My first smart phone was a cheap Samsung Dart. I was so excited to finally get to download apps! The first app I downloaded was Facebook, and then I started looking for apps to edit my photos. Now I can't imagine not having a smart phone!"
5755,prompt,Would you rather get everything you want materially or find your true love?
5756,General Response,"I would rather get everything I want materially, because true love does not exist. It is a manufactured identity to drive financial institutions, develop society, and promote class prejudice."
5757,prompt,Would you rather get everything you want materially or find your true love?
5758,General Response,"I would rather have material things than true love. Maybe I've just been burned too many times, but divorce is a nasty thing and it's changed my ability to even think true love is a thing."
5759,prompt,Would you rather get everything you want materially or find your true love?
5760,General Response,"True love, hands down. Material things come and go and don't really make you happy. Things can't love you back either."

It would be nice to have every random thing that I ever think I want, but things can't replace the unconditional love from a person that you think the world of. Things aren't going to be there to bring you chicken soup on the couch when you're sick, or hold your hand when you're walking through the park on a perfect spring day. Love is much more important than things."

5783,prompt,Are you a very organized person?

Misplacing things has become more common to me.  but I can't blame it all on aging.  I've never been real organized; in fact I've always been somewhat careless, especially with unimportant things.  There are some good things about me.  being organized is not one of them."

6011,prompt,"If some of the lesser known holidays were commercialized, what would the commercialization look like?"
6012,General Response,The commercialization would look very nationalistic and with a lot of consumerism. The holidays would focus on spending time with family and friends. The focus would also emphasize food and drinking.
6013,prompt,"If some of the lesser known holidays were commercialized, what would the commercialization look like?"
6014,General Response,"Cards, gifts like every other holiday. They would find some way to sell some kind of knick knack, hat, shirt etc to make money off us"
6015,prompt,What is a controversial opinion you have?
6016,General Response,"My most controversial opinion has got to be the death penalty. On the one hand, it deters crimes like murder and punishes bad people. On the other hand, innocent people sometimes die. Regardless, I think the death penalty is an integral part of our society."

6021,prompt,What is a controversial opinion you have?
6022,General Response,I am an atheist. This is very controversial since I live in a small town in the southwest. I actually live in a very small town in West Texas. I also am raising my children with clarity of mind and choose not to maintain the false premise of Santa Claus and other such myths with them. Children are actually very intuitive and it is most easy to maintain reason and truth with them rather than try to betray their logic with mainstream mythology.
6023,prompt,What is a controversial opinion you have?
6024,General Response,I think the fact that I'm pro choice when it comes to abortions is a huge controversial subject for anyone. I probably shouldn't even bring it up now! Its a subject I have a very strong opinion on and others who don't agree might be angered with my opinion.
6025,prompt,What are your three biggest life goals right now?
6026,General Response,"To get my back surgery, to buy a house and to pay off my debts are my 3 biggest goals right now.

6053,prompt,What was the worst fashion trend that you secretly want to see come back?

I still remember how thrilling they were to this day."
6063,prompt,What was the worst book you had to read for school? How about the best book you had to read for school?

6065,prompt,Would you rather have overly large hands or very small feet?

6068,General Response,I would rather have large hands than small feet. I could grab things easier with larger hands.
6069,prompt,Would you rather have overly large hands or very small feet?
6070,General Response,"I've got this image of myself with huge hands like some balloon monster. So, I guess I'd have to say that I'd rather have small feet than overly large hands. You can get away with small feet without anybody noticing. But if you're walking around with massive, block smashing hands, that's going to draw the wrong kind of attention."
6071,prompt,Would you rather have overly large hands or very small feet?
6072,General Response,I'd rather have small feet because they'd be able to be hidden by long skirts if I didn't want them seen.
6073,prompt,Would you rather have overly large hands or very small feet?
6074,General Response,I would rather have overly large hands because very small feet can cause more problems for me than having very large hands.

6076,General Response,I am a very helpful person and i help whenever i can and in whatever way i can.
6077,prompt,How often do you help others? Who do you help? How do you help?
6078,General Response,I help others particularly my ex-girlfriend who has a child and whose husband has died.

6089,prompt,"If you could live anywhere on this planet, and take anything that you love with you, where would you choose to live?"
6090,General Response,If I could live anywhere on this planet I would probably go back to my childhood love.

6093,prompt,"If you could live anywhere on this planet, and take anything that you love with you, where would you choose to live?"

6101,prompt,Would you rather have a paid for luxury two-bedroom apartment in a big city of your choice or a free mansion out in the country?
6102,General Response,A luxury two bedroom apartment. I would love to live downtown and not have to drive into downtown. I would enjoy the craziness of downtown living for a while. Could you imagine all the good food that would be within walking or delivery distance? I can hardly get pizza delivered in my neighborhood and its not in the middle of nowhere!
6103,prompt,Would you rather have a paid for luxury two-bedroom apartment in a big city of your choice or a free mansion out in the country?
6104,General Response,I would rather have a free luxury apartment in the city because it would be safer than living in a secluded environment where anyone could attack me unnoticed.
6105,prompt,Have you ever saved an animals life? How about a persons life?
6106,General Response,"To my knowledge, I've never saved a person's life.

I have also saved some larger animals in my life, such as toads on a road and a baby bunny my dog found."
6107,prompt,Have you ever saved an animals life? How about a persons life?
6108,General Response,I have saved an animal's life. I found a baby opossum after his mother had been killed by a cat and I raised him until he was old enough to be released. I have probably not saved a human life but if I could I would.
6109,prompt,Have you ever saved an animals life? How about a persons life?
6110,General Response,"Once my dad and I were fishing in our rubber raft and a woman and her husband tipped over their canoe. The woman was wearing a heavy coat, cowboy boots and could not swim. Her husband was trying to save her and himself but he was weighed down by his own clothing and boots. I quickly untied our boat and my dad rowed as fast as he could. Luckily I was able to hang over the boat and reach as far as I could down into the water and reach the womans hair. We rowed them to shore and they were both saved. This was very hard for a 10 year old."
6111,prompt,Have you ever saved an animals life? How about a persons life?
6112,General Response,"I haven't ever saved an animals life, nor a humans life. However, in the moment, I thought I did save a humans life. I was leaving work at night and traveling on the West Seattle bridge. It was empty. I was driving westbound and a car on the other side was traveling eastbound. All of a sudden it started doing barrel rolls and landed right side up right next to the little cement barriers that divide the highway you know? I had came to a screeching halt, ran out and took their pulse. Called 911. Waited with them. A taxi of guys coming back from the bar also pulled over and started praying around the person. It was crazy. They barely had a pulse and weren't using a seatbelt, because they were upside down in the drivers seat. I got a call from the offer closing the investigation like a year later telling me they passed away. It was really sad. I'll never forget that moment. I wish I could've done more."
6113,prompt,Have you ever saved an animals life? How about a persons life?
6114,General Response,"We save animals all the time...they don't call us black sheep farms for nothing!  I recently took in my cousin and her two cats.  The cousin was being abused by her boyfriend and the cats were sick and malnourished.  The cats required some vet visits, but they're both doing great now.  My cousin is learning to stand on her own two feet again, but some days it's like having another kid."
6115,prompt,Would you rather have a third eye or a third ear?
6116,General Response,"I would rather have a third eye. Can you imagine how handy that would be when you are trying to do many things at a time.

If I had a 3rd eye on the back of my head, I wouldn't need to actually turn around!"
6117,prompt,Would you rather have a third eye or a third ear?
6118,General Response,I would like a third eye so I can see clearer without wearing glasses. I can hear ok with my two ears.

6120,General Response,I would rather have a third eye because it would be more attractive and I would rather see better than hear better.

6122,General Response,I would rather have a third ear because perhaps I could hear beautiful sounds that I miss while listening to other things.
6123,prompt,Would you rather have a third eye or a third ear?
6124,General Response,"A 3rd eye would be pretty hard to hide, so I would have to choose a third ear. That way I could cover it up with my hair or a hat."
6125,prompt,Would you rather lose your ability to speak or have to say everything you are thinking?
6126,General Response,"I would rather lose my ability to speak than be forced to say everything that I am thinking. Nobody is perfect, and not a single person could honestly say they never think something cruel, dark, or inappropriate. I would hate for my thoughts to be made public and risk those thoughts hurting someone I cared about."
6127,prompt,Would you rather lose your ability to speak or have to say everything you are thinking?
6128,General Response,"Oh man, I guess I would rather lose my ability to speak. No one needs to know all the thoughts that go through my head! I would think everyone would feel the same way. Maybe then I could learn to text as fast as my daughter."
6129,prompt,Would you rather lose your ability to speak or have to say everything you are thinking?
6130,General Response,Lose my ability to speak. Now there's a lot of technology to help you communicate so I don't think it would be so bad.
6131,prompt,Would you rather lose your ability to speak or have to say everything you are thinking?
6132,General Response,I would rather lose the ability to speak. I say that because if i say everything that i am thinking i would have no friends or family. I have strong opinions.
6133,prompt,Would you rather lose your ability to speak or have to say everything you are thinking?
6134,General Response,"My son has asked me this before, and I stand by my original answer of losing my ability to speak. I can always sign something, or write something down. But I couldn't undue the hurt feelings or lost friendships due to my big mouth. I can be really moody, too, when I'm sleep deprived, so I'd hate to say something out of anger and hurt someone close to me."
6135,prompt,What is the best thing about traveling? How about the worst thing?
6136,General Response,"Traveling is fun. You get to view different cultures, eat different foods, and meet different people.

6141,prompt,What is the best thing about traveling? How about the worst thing?
6142,General Response,"The best thing, for me, is the chance to see and experience new things. If I were to travel abroad, I would learn as much of the native culture and history that I could. The worst thing? Apart from being agoraphobic to begin with would be the fear of the unknown. To run into a situation that you hadn't anticipated, so you're left clueless as to how to remove yourself from it."
6143,prompt,What is the best thing about traveling? How about the worst thing?
6144,General Response,"The best thing about traveling is enjoying different sights from the ones you see every day. However, the worst thing is how expensive it could be."

6148,General Response,I would rather have a dog as a pet because they seem to more consistent on wanting that friendly companionship.

6149,prompt,Would you rather have a dog as a pet or a cat as a pet?
6150,General Response,"I have actually been really torn between this! I grew up with cats so they are mostly what I know, so naturally cats would be my answer. However my fiance has dogs and when I think about it dogs can be more fun and less cleanup! So I guess Dogs!"
6151,prompt,Would you rather have a dog as a pet or a cat as a pet?
6152,General Response,If I had to choose between having a dog or a cat as a pet I would definitely choose the cat because they're much more self-sufficient. I don't have the kind of life where I can be home to take the dog out every couple hours.
6153,prompt,Would you rather have a dog as a pet or a cat as a pet?
6154,General Response,"I'd rather have a dog, because I find them less disgusting in comparison to cats."
6155,prompt,Would you rather set the table before dinner or clean up after dinner?
6156,General Response,"I'd rather set the table, dishes are the worst chore ever invented! Especially when you are full and just want to relax."

6159,prompt,Would you rather set the table before dinner or clean up after dinner?

6161,prompt,Would you rather set the table before dinner or clean up after dinner?
6162,General Response,I would rather set the table before dinner. The reason I say that is I really dont like doing dishes. Im not very good at it and it always takes me way to long.
6163,prompt,Would you rather set the table before dinner or clean up after dinner?
6164,General Response,"I would rather set the table before dinner than to clean up afterwards. After dinner, it is later in the day and my belly is full of food. This makes me feel lethargic. I would rather do my part of the work while I still have energy. Which would you rather do?"
6165,prompt,Would you rather have a dinosaur as a pet or a unicorn?
6166,General Response,"I would much rather have a unicorn as a pet, dinosaurs have really big teeth, yeah i'll pass on that."

6168,General Response,"A dinosaur, because it would be really cool to ride around town on the back of a T-Rex."
6169,prompt,Would you rather have a dinosaur as a pet or a unicorn?
6170,General Response,"I would rather have a unicorn, because they're so magical and beautiful. Also, a unicorn can be hidden, a dinosaur would be a lot harder to explain as they've been extinct for a while now."
6171,prompt,Would you rather have a dinosaur as a pet or a unicorn?
6172,General Response,I would love to have a unicorn as a pet! They have magical powers and can heal people and they're mammals so they're cuddly and stuff.
6173,prompt,Would you rather have a dinosaur as a pet or a unicorn?
6174,General Response,I would rather have a unicorn for a pet because it would be more peaceful. A dinosaur would be more likely to attack at random.

6177,prompt,Are you where you thought you would be at this point in your life?
6178,General Response,I don't really think this is where I thought I would be at my age but I guess it's where I'm supposed to be. I have no regrets but I suppose I would've done a few things differently.
6179,prompt,Are you where you thought you would be at this point in your life?
6180,General Response,"No I'm definitely not where I want to be at this point in my life. I always thought by 38 years old I would have been married with kids working in a job surrounded by family, friends, etc. Instead, after my marriage fell apart 3 years ago my entire life has changed, not for the worse but seemed to have pushed me back in the progress to where I wanted to be."
6181,prompt,Are you where you thought you would be at this point in your life?

6188,General Response,I would rather run everywhere because crawling usually hurts a lot on your knees.

6195,prompt,Would you rather have everyone know the details of your finances or the details of your love life?
6196,General Response,I would rather have people know the details of my finance instead of my love life. I don't mind people knowing how much money I make or where my debts are. I keep this part of my life very clean. I would not like people knowing who I am dating for sleeping with.
6197,prompt,Would you rather have everyone know the details of your finances or the details of your love life?

6204,General Response,"If I had to choose between the two, I'd go with finances. I don't mind sharing details about my professional life and how much I make, but my love life is personal and something I'd want to keep quiet."
6205,prompt,What would you want your last meal to be if you were on death row?
6206,General Response,I would ask for filet mignon and some smoked salmon.  I have really good memories of dinners with my favorite people with these items on the menu.
6207,prompt,What would you want your last meal to be if you were on death row?
6208,General Response,"I would want my last meal on death row to be a steak along with some a baked potato and asparagus because it's so delicious, I would eat it any time."
6209,prompt,What would you want your last meal to be if you were on death row?
6210,General Response,"The red pill for sure. That way I could fight my way out of an unfair execution. I would never need to be executed, I'm unsure anyone should be."
6211,prompt,What would you want your last meal to be if you were on death row?
6212,General Response,I would eat a whole pizza if given the chance on death row. To me it is the most comforting food.
6213,prompt,What would you want your last meal to be if you were on death row?
6214,General Response,"I would want a full on buffet. Fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, chocolate cake, spicy wings, and for sure sushi."
6215,prompt,Do you prefer traveling alone or with a group?
6216,General Response,"I prefer traveling alone. This way I can explore, meet new people, and do virtually whatever I want."
6217,prompt,Do you prefer traveling alone or with a group?
6218,General Response,I prefer to travel alone so I can set my own plans and do what I want to do.
6219,prompt,Do you prefer traveling alone or with a group?
6220,General Response,I would much rather travel alone. I want to stop when I want and not be on a schedule.
6221,prompt,Do you prefer traveling alone or with a group?
6222,General Response,"That is tough, because I could enjoy either one equally. I'd say, for the sake of it, that I'd prefer to travel with a group. As a female, I'd feel safer with numbers, and it would allow me to interact with adults which I don't get enough of, in my opinion. Plus, if I needed some alone time I could excuse myself, whereas if I were traveling alone it would be harder to just go make a bunch of friends from random strangers! Can you imagine?"
6223,prompt,Do you prefer traveling alone or with a group?
6224,General Response,"I don't like groups; it's just my personality. the group would have to be very small for be to be in it.  On the other hand, traveling alone wouldn't be ideal either because it could get very frustrating.  The best option for me would be to travel with my wife; just the two of us.  But if I had to choose between being in a group, or being alone, I'd definitely travel alone.  At the age of 61, I'm tired of big-mouth arrogant ""know it all"" people who can ruin things in a group.  all it takes is one ""bad apple"" to ruin a good experience.  I'd rather go solo."
6225,prompt,Do you prefer to watch movies in the theater or in the comfort of your own home?
6226,General Response,"I prefer to watch movies in my own home, where I am more comfortable. I am anti-social and do not like being around crowds."

6228,General Response,I prefer to watch movies in a theater as long as it is a private screening. That would be great.
6229,prompt,Do you prefer to watch movies in the theater or in the comfort of your own home?
6230,General Response,"I prefer to watch in my home.  When I'm home I can relax, take off my bra and shoes climb up on my bed, get all comfortable and fall asleep before the beginning credits roll.  Much cheaper too."
6231,prompt,Do you prefer to watch movies in the theater or in the comfort of your own home?
6232,General Response,"I'd rather watch a movie in the theater because the screen is so big, you can get snacks and slushies, and it's a good date activity with my wife."
6233,prompt,Do you prefer to watch movies in the theater or in the comfort of your own home?
6234,General Response,At home. It's much more relaxing and I can fix any problems I have to make it perfect.
6235,prompt,"When you travel do you prefer a single carry on backpack, or a full armada of luggage?"
6236,General Response,"Obviously it depends on the destination, but I still pack light regardless. I can't imagine travelling anywhere that would require more than a backpack of essentials: change of clothes, pair of socks, toothbrush, and a razor I probably wouldn't use anyway. I try to maintain a constant state of leisure where ever I happen to chance upon."
6237,prompt,"When you travel do you prefer a single carry on backpack, or a full armada of luggage?"
6238,General Response,I prefer a single backback because this allows me to condense everything and avoid extra charges.
6239,prompt,"When you travel do you prefer a single carry on backpack, or a full armada of luggage?"
6240,General Response,"I carry a full armada of luggage, because I like to always be prepared. I usually travel with my family, so we always have luggage, but the few times I've gone somewhere on my own, I've brought maybe one suitcase along with me."
6241,prompt,"When you travel do you prefer a single carry on backpack, or a full armada of luggage?"
6242,General Response,"Although I would like to have more items with me than a single carry on backpack can handle, I would prefer the backpack because it would be so much easier to maneuver. I could always grab the things that I could not bring with at a store when I arrived at my destination. It would also save money on luggage fees."
6243,prompt,"When you travel do you prefer a single carry on backpack, or a full armada of luggage?"
6244,General Response,Whenever i travel i prefer a full armada of luggage because i can't really choose what to carry and what to leave.
6245,prompt,What is your favorite thing to eat or drink in winter?

6253,prompt,What is your favorite thing to eat or drink in winter?
6254,General Response,My husband's amazing secret chili recipe is the best thing to eat in the winter!
6255,prompt,What are some good and bad things about the education system in your country?
6256,General Response,"One good thing is that it is available free for all children from age 6 to age 18. On the other hand, the bad thing is that like with most things, you get what you pay for. So our kids who are getting a free education oftentimes aren't getting a very good one."
6257,prompt,What are some good and bad things about the education system in your country?
6258,General Response,"Kids do get education here, but something needs to be done about the one size fits all approach that a lot of schools have.  Different kids have different methods of how they learn best."
6259,prompt,What are some good and bad things about the education system in your country?
6260,General Response,One of the worst things about the education system in the USA is that the quality of the education and funding is highly correlated with wealth class.  Poor people have some of the worst schools.  One good thing is that public schools are free.
6261,prompt,What are some good and bad things about the education system in your country?
6262,General Response,Some good things about the education system in our country is technical. Meaning computers to help us get ahead in the world.

6263,prompt,What are some good and bad things about the education system in your country?
6264,General Response,"I think there are a lot of things to be desired about the education system in my country. I mean, many of the teachers are passionate about what they do and you can tell they really care about the students. But two of the biggest issues facing schools these days are overcrowding and under-funding."
6265,prompt,Would you rather have cookies or cake?

6267,prompt,Would you rather have cookies or cake?
6268,General Response,I would rather have cookies.  They feel more like a true food with real ingredients than some of these fake-ish frostings you get on cakes that are half dried-out anyway.
6269,prompt,Would you rather have cookies or cake?
6270,General Response,"I would rather have cake, because I enjoy a moist desert. Sometimes you get moist cookies but sometimes they are hard too. At least with cake I feel like I know what I'm getting everytime."
6271,prompt,Would you rather have cookies or cake?
6272,General Response,"Oh my goodness, cake, hands down! I love cake, and cupcakes. Some people need a drink after a bad day. Not me, I want vanilla cake with homemade buttercream frosting. I don't know if that's better for you than drinking, but I don't care!"
6273,prompt,Would you rather have cookies or cake?
6274,General Response,"Shoot, I am a fan of both, but nothing beats a nice cookie from time to time."
6275,prompt,Would you eat at a restaurant that was really dirty if the food was amazing?
6276,General Response,"No I don't think I could eat at a Restraunt that was dirty, even if they had good food. I ate at a place and my food was really good but there was a gnat that kept flying around until it eventually landed in my food. I haven't been there since."
6277,prompt,Would you eat at a restaurant that was really dirty if the food was amazing?
6278,General Response,I would not eat at a filthy restaurant no matter how nice the food was. There is no reason to get sick over nice food!

6282,General Response,"I have eaten at a dirty restaurant that had amazing food! My sister and I went out for sushi and then noticed the sanitation rating :( Thinking about it though, my kitchen is not always the cleanest but I make amazing food. Just because they kitchen is dirty doesn't mean the food or the people preparing the food are dirty. Right?"
6283,prompt,Would you eat at a restaurant that was really dirty if the food was amazing?
6284,General Response,I definitely would NOT.  I can find real good food at clean places.  I wouldn't waste my time eating in a dirty restaurant; I'd feel very awkward.

6299,prompt,"If you were a vegetable, what vegetable would you be?"
6300,General Response,"If I were a vegetable, I would be a brussel sprout.  No one eats those I don't think so I would be immortal!"

6304,General Response,Broccoli is the vegetable I would be. I'm short with a strong base. I also have a lot of fluffy hair.
6305,prompt,"Who do you think has the biggest impact on fashion trends: actors and actresses, musicians, fashion designers, or consumers?"
6306,General Response,"I really think actors and actresses do. They are always in the spotlight so people see what is in style. I don't think they dress exactly like them, but they do influence consumers in a big way."
6307,prompt,"Who do you think has the biggest impact on fashion trends: actors and actresses, musicians, fashion designers, or consumers?"
6308,General Response,"The biggest impact on fashion trends are the consumers. It's the girls that where all the stuff and then either make people jealous, or want them, or whatever game they are playing. It's those girls."
6309,prompt,"Who do you think has the biggest impact on fashion trends: actors and actresses, musicians, fashion designers, or consumers?"
6310,General Response,"I think actors and actresses have the biggest impact because they then set the tone for what consumers will buy, who are the group that will make the most purchases in terms of quantity."
6311,prompt,"Who do you think has the biggest impact on fashion trends: actors and actresses, musicians, fashion designers, or consumers?"
6312,General Response,Consumers have the biggest impact. Not everyone wears something because it is a trend .Without the consumer buying there is no trend and people wear what they like in the end.
6313,prompt,"Who do you think has the biggest impact on fashion trends: actors and actresses, musicians, fashion designers, or consumers?"

6315,prompt,How has the education you received changed your life?
6316,General Response,The education I received gave me opportunities to excel and succeed and find a job and beyond my education I made most of my lifelong friends in college. They changed my life.
6317,prompt,How has the education you received changed your life?
6318,General Response,It hasn't really changed it all that much. The programming language I was taught to start my college experience is outdated. If I had waited a couple of years I would have started learning C++ and Java and that would have changed things!
6319,prompt,How has the education you received changed your life?
6320,General Response,"Well, I can read, write, and do math. Math helps me figure out bills, reading is entertaining and useful when it comes to signs, instructions, and warnings, and writing is useful for writing notes, lists, stories, orders, and whatever else you might write."
6321,prompt,How has the education you received changed your life?
6322,General Response,The education I received has allowed me to get a job that paid better than if I had not been trained in any skills.
6323,prompt,How has the education you received changed your life?
6324,General Response,It taught me I'm stupid if thats what you mean.
6325,prompt,Would you rather eat a small can of cat food or eat two rotten tomatoes?
6326,General Response,"Haha! I think I would have to go for the cat food. Some of it doesn't smell to bad. Doesn't it list some human food on the labels? See it couldn't be that awful, could it?"
6327,prompt,Would you rather eat a small can of cat food or eat two rotten tomatoes?
6328,General Response,"I would rather eat a small can of cat food than two rotten tomatoes.  I think the chance of getting sick is greater with the tomatoes, so I would avoid that."
6329,prompt,Would you rather eat a small can of cat food or eat two rotten tomatoes?
6330,General Response,"great question! talk about a ""no win"" situation!  I want no part of cat food.  I wouldn't eat cat food unless I was facing starvation.  just the thought of it almost makes me sick.  I'd take my chances on the two rotten tomatoes.  I'd put a lot of different spices on them, maybe add a little sauce, hold my nose and hope I didn't become sick.  but it would be so much better than eating food made for a cat."
6331,prompt,Would you rather eat a small can of cat food or eat two rotten tomatoes?
6332,General Response,The cat food for sure. Rotten food would be scary because that stuff can make you very ill.
6333,prompt,Would you rather eat a small can of cat food or eat two rotten tomatoes?
6334,General Response,I would totally eat a small can of cat food instead of anything rotten! Rotten would imply that it would be dangerous to my health. Something canned that is meant for a pet would not be dangerous.

6347,prompt,What old trend is coming back these days?
6348,General Response,"Bell bottoms pops into my mind. Sometimes, I even see them paired with platform shoes! Picturing this outfit brings visions of disco dancing back to life."

6352,General Response,"I don't know, but I'd certainly like if politeness and good manners staged a comeback!"
6353,prompt,What old trend is coming back these days?
6354,General Response,"Leggings are coming back.They have even been in the news, due to some not-so-well-dressed family members or airline employees.I think as long as they have something over them and not worn like jeans, which is what made them go out of style in the first place, they will continue to be thought of as a classic fashion item."
6355,prompt,What piece of technology would look like magic or a miracle to people in medieval Europe?

6357,prompt,What piece of technology would look like magic or a miracle to people in medieval Europe?
6358,General Response,"Playstation games.  Especially if it is a game of medieval people at battle.  A lot of those games look so realistic, it would seem magical to have people on a little box (TV) who look like them."
6359,prompt,What piece of technology would look like magic or a miracle to people in medieval Europe?
6360,General Response,"I think having a smart phone with internet access would look like magic to people in the medieval period. Reason being is because the phone would have access to the internet, which has all the knowledge of people thus far."
6361,prompt,What piece of technology would look like magic or a miracle to people in medieval Europe?
6362,General Response,Cell phones would certainy look like magic or a miracle to people in medieval Europe. Just the phone without even the internet or service would be amazing. The internet and data attached would really blow their minds.
6363,prompt,What piece of technology would look like magic or a miracle to people in medieval Europe?
6364,General Response,A cellphone would look like a miracle to people in medieval Europe and probably get a lynch mob after you at the same time. Showing these people who have little to no technological capabilities would surely make them either envy you or want to kill you.

6371,prompt,I love movie theater popcorn! What is your favorite movie theater snack?
6372,General Response,"What is it about movie theater popcorn that makes it taste so good? Is it the experience and part of the package so to speak or is it all that greasy, melty, butter we put on it? I get popcorn the most as a snack but what I really love, are twizlers. Maybe it goes back to when I was a kid, and we got to choose one treat to sneak in moms purse to the movies, not sure, but they are my favorite."
6373,prompt,I love movie theater popcorn! What is your favorite movie theater snack?
6374,General Response,Same for me. You can't go to the movies and skip the popcorn. That's the biggest reason I go to the movies.
6375,prompt,Would you rather have to eat a bowl full of worms or a live frog?

6378,General Response,They're both disgusting but if I have to choose I'd rather eat worms. I can just gulp them  down without chewing.
6379,prompt,Would you rather have to eat a bowl full of worms or a live frog?
6380,General Response,"I would rather eat a bowl full of worms. I think they wound be easier to swallow than to have to bite into a live frog. Also since the frog is a live frog, I can assume the worms are dead already. Right?"
6381,prompt,Would you rather have to eat a bowl full of worms or a live frog?
6382,General Response,"I actually have a recipe for worms, so I would go with that. We have a big colony of frogs that we encourage in our garden. They help with the pest control and so it would be sacrilegious for me to harm a frog. A live one would also be a factor. I would not like to experience their movement in my mouth. It would be impossible!"
6383,prompt,Would you rather have to eat a bowl full of worms or a live frog?
6384,General Response,"A bowl of live worms seems like a more appealing choice. A live frog would constantly be trying to jump away from you, but worms can't get  anywhere very fast so it would be over quicker."
6385,prompt,What will the future of education be?
6386,General Response,"Everyone will have Virtual Reality devices, who can get access to them, and then all education will be online for free. That way people will have ethics, because as soon as everyone has ethics, this world will be really, really awesome."
6387,prompt,What will the future of education be?
6388,General Response,"My future in education will be to finish 2 more classes, which will give me a Master's degree in Psychology."

6393,prompt,What will the future of education be?
6394,General Response,The future of education will be more people reading and learning in their own terms rather than adhering to a strict schedule created by school administrators.

6402,General Response,There are a lot of song lyrics I think are terrible but mostly all the ones that use the F bomb.
6403,prompt,What is the worst song lyric you have ever heard?
6404,General Response,"Honestly, there are so many terribly-written songs out there, I can't say for sure which is the worst. But the theme song to thst Star Trek prequel series, Enterprise, is so cheestly that I cannot watch the show."
6405,prompt,Would you rather make a movie of your life before you were twenty-one or a movie of your life after the age of twenty-one?
6406,General Response,"No doubt about it, it would be after the age of twenty-one.  Before I was twenty-one, things were pretty dull.  After twenty-one I left home for the first time, had my first real relationship with a woman, started my career, changed my religious outlook and became a parent.  So many things have happened since I was twenty-one.  In fact, I'm sixty-one now and about to become a first time grandfather.  No doubt about it, a movie about my after the age of twenty-one would be much more interesting."
6407,prompt,Would you rather make a movie of your life before you were twenty-one or a movie of your life after the age of twenty-one?
6408,General Response,I would rather have a movie of my life after the age of 21 because that's when all the interesting stuff happened.
6409,prompt,Would you rather make a movie of your life before you were twenty-one or a movie of your life after the age of twenty-one?
6410,General Response,"I would make a movie of my life before 21 because  had a lot of crazy things happen before 21.  After 21, my life was more typical, so it might now make such an interesting drama for a movie."
6411,prompt,Would you rather make a movie of your life before you were twenty-one or a movie of your life after the age of twenty-one?
6412,General Response,I'd rather make a movie of my life after twenty-one because I was a Marine and I did some pretty cool stuff after I turned twenty-one.
6413,prompt,Would you rather make a movie of your life before you were twenty-one or a movie of your life after the age of twenty-one?
6414,General Response,I'd rather make a movie of my life after age twenty-one.  Nothing interesting or exciting happened to shape me into who I am today until after that point.
6415,prompt,Would you rather be a famous movie star or a member of your favorite popular music group?
6416,General Response,I would rather be a famous music star or rockstar.  Rockstars are usually way cooler and more genuine than a Hollywood actor.

6418,General Response,A famous movie star. The career itself appeals to me more and seems to have more longevity.
6419,prompt,Would you rather be a famous movie star or a member of your favorite popular music group?
6420,General Response,I would rather be a member of my favorite music group because it would be much more satisfying touring the world and playing music.

6422,General Response,I would rather be a member of one of my favorite music groups. I have been an amateur musician for over 16 years and find performing music to be equally challenging and rewarding.
6423,prompt,Would you rather be a famous movie star or a member of your favorite popular music group?
6424,General Response,"A movie star for sure, singing is not my thing, I'm way more of an actor then a singer.  I'm pretty good at taking on different personas."
6425,prompt,Would you rather have everyone know about your personal finances or know the details of your romantic life?
6426,General Response,"I've made some pretty big mistakes with finances and my not so hot dates. In fact, my romantic life should be in a book but my personal finances should never be looked at, sometimes even by me."
6427,prompt,Would you rather have everyone know about your personal finances or know the details of your romantic life?
6428,General Response,I don't think it would bother me if people knew both. I think it would be more of a problem for them being in someone else's private matters.
6429,prompt,Would you rather have everyone know about your personal finances or know the details of your romantic life?
6430,General Response,I would rather everyone know my romantic life because there i not much to it to know.
6431,prompt,Would you rather have everyone know about your personal finances or know the details of your romantic life?
6432,General Response,I'd rather have everyone know my romantic life. I tell everyone about it anyway.
6433,prompt,Would you rather have everyone know about your personal finances or know the details of your romantic life?
6434,General Response,I would rather people know the details of my romantic life than my personal finances.  Other people having knowledge of your personal finances can lead to fraud.
6435,prompt,What do you bring with you everywhere you go?
6436,General Response,"I need my pen. It's a normal ordinary blue ballpoint pen and it has to be on my person or nearby always. I can't survive without it. I'll write notes on my wrist if I don't have paper handy, so I don't even really need the notebook that I usually (but not always) carry with me, but I have to have my pen."
6437,prompt,What do you bring with you everywhere you go?
6438,General Response,"I take my cell phone with me everywhere, it's a great distraction for little boys who don't want to be in the car anymore."
6439,prompt,What do you bring with you everywhere you go?
6440,General Response,"I bring my purse everywhere I go. I don't have enough pockets to carry my wallet, sunglasses, keys, pens, brush, and toddler snacks!"

6446,General Response,"Being a girl, I wouldn't want to be extremely tall because I would probably get made fun of alot."
6447,prompt,Would you rather be very short or extremely tall?
6448,General Response,I would rather be extremely tall.  I am on the short side and it would be nice to not have trouble reaching things for a change.
6449,prompt,Would you rather be very short or extremely tall?
6450,General Response,"I'm pretty short. Okay I'm really short, and I'm fine with that. I can duck under things better than most people, if I even ""have"" to duck, and if I fall, it's not such a long way down before I hit the ground."
6451,prompt,Would you rather be very short or extremely tall?
6452,General Response,I have always said I would rather be short. You can always climb up on stuff to reach high stuff even being short but being tall you can't fit into smaller spaces or crawl under things as well. Being short is pretty handy sometimes.
6453,prompt,Would you rather be very short or extremely tall?
6454,General Response,I would much rather be extremely tall. I would be able to reach everything!
6455,prompt,How is life?
6456,General Response,"Life is hard and wonderful at the same time. Everyday I face new problems and challenges but I also get to experience new and exciting things. Really life is what you put into it, if you're negative, there is a good chance it will be harder. If you keep a positive attitude, the things that come to you are amazing."
6457,prompt,How is life?
6458,General Response,Life is good but you have to take the good with the bad.  Life is a learning experience and is also like a roller coaster.  You make your choices and learn later if they were the right ones and learn from there.
6459,prompt,How is life?
6460,General Response,"It is not as bad as it was for me a year ago when I had an emotional breakdown, but I cannot say I am at 100% either. I just met a great guy though, so things are looking up."

6462,General Response,Life is good. Life is interesting and life is never dull. I feel like I have lived a good life with accomplishments to show for it.
6463,prompt,How is life?
6464,General Response,"I think life is what you make it.  Let's face it, we all have pressures, and bad things happen.  I think the key is, and it's easier said than done, to focus on the positive aspects of life.  Let me tell you...I have fallen down in this concept from time to time and it wasn't pleasant.  the idea is to stay positive.  it's not always easy, but it's a good idea to try for."
6465,prompt,"If you have to travel a long distance, do you prefer plane, train or car?"
6466,General Response,"When I travel a long distance, I must admit that I am terrified of flying but I actually prefer it because let's face it, time in a car can be exhausting!"
6467,prompt,"If you have to travel a long distance, do you prefer plane, train or car?"
6468,General Response,I would travel by car because a I have to do is buy gas and put it in the car and go where I need to go.
6469,prompt,"If you have to travel a long distance, do you prefer plane, train or car?"
6470,General Response,"I very much prefer traveling by plane. I tend to get carsick on long trips, and I love taking off in a plane."
6471,prompt,"If you have to travel a long distance, do you prefer plane, train or car?"
6472,General Response,"If I'm in the mood for a long trip, a car ride.  But if I want to get there fast I would prefer plane."
6473,prompt,"If you have to travel a long distance, do you prefer plane, train or car?"
6474,General Response,I prefer a plane for traveling long distances because it really cuts down on the time to get there.
6475,prompt,Would you rather have a one month paid vacation or not have to pay taxes on your income for a year?
6476,General Response,"I would rather have no income taxes for a year because the taxes amount to more than the month paid vacation.  I am self-employed anyway, so it's not like work is unbearable."
6477,prompt,Would you rather have a one month paid vacation or not have to pay taxes on your income for a year?
6478,General Response,I would rather have a month of vacation. I really love traveling and seeing new things around the world. If I had a month off vacation I would spend it doing just that. One month should be enough time to travel and see some new places.
6479,prompt,Would you rather have a one month paid vacation or not have to pay taxes on your income for a year?
6480,General Response,"No taxes! To be honest, I wouldn't know where to go for a month. I'd be bored and restless."
6481,prompt,Would you rather have a one month paid vacation or not have to pay taxes on your income for a year?
6482,General Response,"I would want to pay no taxes for a year. I think taxes are a bigger chunk of my income than what I make a month, so I would take the extra money and then look at using it for fun activities."
6483,prompt,Would you rather have a one month paid vacation or not have to pay taxes on your income for a year?
6484,General Response,I would much rather not have to pay taxes for a whole year because that would save me a ton of money.
6485,prompt,Who shot first (Han or Greedo)?
6486,General Response,Greedo shot first. Han shot back Greedo missed. It actually depends on what year you saw the film. In later releases George Lucas added extra frames to the film to make Hans look less like a cold blooded killer and showed Greedo shooting first.
6487,prompt,Who shot first (Han or Greedo)?
6488,General Response,"I can't answer this question, because I don't know anything about either person."
6489,prompt,Who shot first (Han or Greedo)?
6490,General Response,"Oh man, here's my problem. I don't know. I mean, I know about the debate and I have watched the Star Wars movies, but who really knows the answer there? Hmm? I definitely don't."
6491,prompt,Who shot first (Han or Greedo)?
6492,General Response,I think Han shot first. Part of the problem with this question though is that there are different cuts of the movie that give you different impressions.
6493,prompt,Who shot first (Han or Greedo)?
6494,General Response,"Everyone knows Han shot first. If you think otherwise, I don't even consider you a real fan."
6495,prompt,Would you rather listen to songs you have no control over 24 hours a day for a year or listen to your favorite song 24 hours a day for a year?
6496,General Response,I would choose songs that I had no control over for a year. I don't want to grow to hate my favorite song and I might actually pick up some new songs that I enjoy over the course of the year.
6497,prompt,Would you rather listen to songs you have no control over 24 hours a day for a year or listen to your favorite song 24 hours a day for a year?
6498,General Response,"I would rather listen to my favorite song 24 hours a day for a year. If I have to endure torture, I might as well get to enjoy it. Some songs though, man, some songs make me run out of stores they are so annoying."
6499,prompt,Would you rather listen to songs you have no control over 24 hours a day for a year or listen to your favorite song 24 hours a day for a year?
6500,General Response,Once there was a radio station that played a song for 24 hours straight. It was pretty obnoxious but tolerable. I hate to ruin a good song that I love and wouldn't ever want to hear again. I guess it depends on how bad that other song I can't control is.
6501,prompt,Would you rather listen to songs you have no control over 24 hours a day for a year or listen to your favorite song 24 hours a day for a year?
6502,General Response,"I think I would rather listen to songs you have no control instead of my favorite songs for over 24 hours a day for a year, because that way I'd get a variety of different songs and I'm pretty if I listened to the same songs over and over, they wouldn't be my favorite songs anymore; I'd get pretty tired of them."
6503,prompt,Would you rather listen to songs you have no control over 24 hours a day for a year or listen to your favorite song 24 hours a day for a year?
6504,General Response,"I like to think I play guitar, but other people may have a different opinion on the matter, but music still plays a major role in my life. It's healing, cathartic, and soothing. I like the spontaneity of radio, and when a favorite song starts to play I can't help feel that it's a treat, even though I probably have the CD in my car or the song on my iPhone. Unfortunately, Murphy's Law dictates that less than stellar songs will make it through the air waves and the favorite song will begin when you're thirty seconds from arriving at your destination. I have to have variety, so I would definitely choose to listen to songs I have no control over."
6505,prompt,What do you do to improve your mood when you are in a bad mood?
6506,General Response,I find that listening to music helps improve my mood especially if the lyrics are upbeat.
6507,prompt,What do you do to improve your mood when you are in a bad mood?
6508,General Response,When I'm in a bad mood I like to listen to music or drive around. Sometimes a shower helps me feel better to.
6509,prompt,What do you do to improve your mood when you are in a bad mood?
6510,General Response,I talk to my best friend when I am in a bad mood and that will generally improve my mood. I will also go on a hike or sit outside just to absorb the energy from nature.
6511,prompt,What do you do to improve your mood when you are in a bad mood?
6512,General Response,"Whenever I'm in a bad mood, I force my self to smile. Its a great trick called, fake it until you make it. I saw a Ted Talk where a researcher explained that forcing yourself into certain body language patterns actually has an effect on your mood and confidence."
6513,prompt,What do you do to improve your mood when you are in a bad mood?
6514,General Response,When I'm in a bad mood I like to exercise so that the physical exertion will get my mind off of my troubles.
6515,prompt,Which app seemed like magic the first time you used it?
6516,General Response,Truecaller app seemed like magic the first time i used it because finally i could discover who those annoying callers were.
6517,prompt,Which app seemed like magic the first time you used it?
6518,General Response,"Waze. I like how it not only gives me directions, but also tells me what to expect along the way as far as traffic, potholes and other traffic/driving related issues I should know about."
6519,prompt,Which app seemed like magic the first time you used it?
6520,General Response,"My SnapChat app seemed pretty magical the first time I used it and it still use, because the creators and designers continue to add new ideas and tools to make it even more magical."
6521,prompt,Which app seemed like magic the first time you used it?
6522,General Response,The Zippo app seemed like magic at first because it was one of the earliest apps that showed the gyroscopic effect of the iPhone.
6523,prompt,Which app seemed like magic the first time you used it?
6524,General Response,The app that surprised me the most and seemed like magic was that Shazaam app.
6525,prompt,"Do you prefer having someone cook for you, or cooking for yourself?"
6526,General Response,"Sometimes, when I am very tired, I would prefer having someone cook for me, but usually I like eating the food I made for myself"
6527,prompt,"Do you prefer having someone cook for you, or cooking for yourself?"
6528,General Response,I like to cook for myself because I know exactly what I am eating and I know how it was prepared.
6529,prompt,"Do you prefer having someone cook for you, or cooking for yourself?"
6530,General Response,I prefer to have someone cook for me because I cannot cook well and this also gives me a chance to relax.
6531,prompt,"Do you prefer having someone cook for you, or cooking for yourself?"
6532,General Response,I love when my husband cooks because it gives me a break and well hes really good at it. I dont know if I would want anyone else to outside of a restaurant
6533,prompt,"Do you prefer having someone cook for you, or cooking for yourself?"
6534,General Response,I prefer to cook for myself and make my own food. If the food comes out terrible or bad then I have only myself to blame. I prefer to be independent and do things for myself. Cooking for myself also allows me to make what ever I am in the mood for.
6535,prompt,Do you like horror movies? Why or why not?
6536,General Response,"I love scary movies that could be realistic, those campfire tails that come to life on the big screen and get your heart racing are the best. I don't like the slasher films though, like Chucky or Freddy Krueger type films, they are just silly."
6537,prompt,Do you like horror movies? Why or why not?
6538,General Response,"Horror movies are my favorite types of movies. I love all sorts, like monster movies, campy slasher movies, and alien movies too. My favorite is Halloween 2."
6539,prompt,Do you like horror movies? Why or why not?
6540,General Response,"I have never liked horror movies I always find them kind of nauseating. The reason I don't like them is half the time the people in them behave very stupidly and you just want to tell them, ""No don't do that!"""
6541,prompt,Do you like horror movies? Why or why not?
6542,General Response,"I don't like all of them, but there's plenty that I do like. I can't watch them alone though, way too scary."
6543,prompt,Do you like horror movies? Why or why not?
6544,General Response,I really don't! I suppose I scare rather easily and I prefer not to put certain images in my head where they may reappear later at night when I'm alone.
6545,prompt,What was your first kiss like?
6546,General Response,My first kiss was at 11. It was awkward and I remember thinking his mouth tasted like metal. It was in the school yard while my friends giggled.
6547,prompt,What was your first kiss like?
6548,General Response,"It was a passionate, French kiss.  French kissing seems natural to me, and a traditional peck kiss isn't satisfying for me."
6549,prompt,What was your first kiss like?
6550,General Response,"I was very young and it was with a classmate of mine. It was fun and exciting. We haven't spoken in years and it was just puppy love, but it was very sweet."
6551,prompt,What was your first kiss like?
6552,General Response,If you ignore the fact I missed their mouth I think I did a pretty good job
6553,prompt,What was your first kiss like?
6554,General Response,"It was magical,a kind of feeling that one can only experience to really know it."
6555,prompt,What do you think of tattoos? Do you have any?
6556,General Response,"I do have a tattoo, and I think they're great. I have a tattoo of a snake on my calf, and a tattoo of my son's name on my chest. I'm looking into getting another one, maybe my other son's name once he's born."
6557,prompt,What do you think of tattoos? Do you have any?
6558,General Response,"I don't have any tattoos. My thinking is that they are for life, and yet my values, attitudes and body changed as I was growing up, and even though adulthood. A tattoo I selected at age 20 might not be a choice I wanted at age 40. Isn't it better to establish individuality with clothing, hair style, accessories etc? These are changeable, but a tattoo isn't. Okay, laser removal is available, but from what I hear it isn't cheap nor blemish-free.

But that is just me. I know there are others who chose a tattoo and have been happy with it."
6559,prompt,What do you think of tattoos? Do you have any?
6560,General Response,"I love tattoos, but I don't have any. I'm afraid of that kind of commitment, not afraid of needles. Maybe one day the right tattoo idea will come to mind and I will take the plunge!"
6561,prompt,What do you think of tattoos? Do you have any?
6562,General Response,"I have one tatoo. I've wanted a tatoo my whole life. Finally, at the age of 54, I got a butterfly tatooed on my leg. Ouch!"
6563,prompt,What do you think of tattoos? Do you have any?
6564,General Response,"I think tattoos are fine so long as the placement and artwork is aligned with who the person is when they have it done as well as who they are planning to be in the future. Many tattoos are a past self's bad decision that the current or future self will have to deal with. I do have a tattoo, I'm happy with both the design and placement (and patting my past self on the head for being wise enough to have it done where it can't be unless I'm wearing clothes meant to display it.)"
6565,prompt,"If you could, would you communicate entirely with memes?"
6566,General Response,"Probably, I quite enjoy memes but I think that would be hard task to find the correct meme for every situation and it would be an inappropriate way to communicate."
6567,prompt,"If you could, would you communicate entirely with memes?"
6568,General Response,"I already pretty much only use memes. Actually, I used to make new ones up all the time, but I got bored of it. Maybe, I should get back into that."
6569,prompt,"If you could, would you communicate entirely with memes?"
6570,General Response,"As much as I love memes, I don't think I could communicate using just them. I like sending them to people and looking at them and laughing, but I don't see them much as a form of communication. There aren't that many that could be used in everyday conversations. Although, small talk would be so much more bearable if everyone just used memes."
6571,prompt,"If you could, would you communicate entirely with memes?"
6572,General Response,you can say anything with memes. If I had to I could find a meme saying anything I need it to say or I can make my own.
6573,prompt,"If you could, would you communicate entirely with memes?"
6574,General Response,No.  I prefer straight forward communication.  Reactions and feelings can only be understood and express through talking.
6575,prompt,Where is the worst place you have been stuck for a long time?
6576,General Response,"I try to live a life without regrets and I like to see things half full than empty, so this question was at first a little difficult. Then all of a sudden I remembered my very worst working experience! It was in a family run business, where the owners were in such dire financial straights. They were in complete denial that they were in the very worst shape when they decided to hire me on. It was a couple and the wife was rarely at the business and the husband had a very bad spending habit. He decided to spend his money on me and the current lot of employees were none too happy to see me on board, since after the initial honeymoon period I was to get on board as commission. I got out of that desperate situation as quickly as I could, but it was the worst month of my career."
6577,prompt,Where is the worst place you have been stuck for a long time?
6578,General Response,I worst place that I have been stuck in for a long time was traffic in the nearest city. This was terrible because I could move the car of do anything to help the situation. I was completely helpless and it was wasting my time.
6579,prompt,Where is the worst place you have been stuck for a long time?
6580,General Response,I was stuck on a military base where I didn't want to be. I was waiting a long time to be transferred to another base.
6581,prompt,Where is the worst place you have been stuck for a long time?
6582,General Response,"Seriously, I was once stuck on a rural highway in West Virginia as night was coming. I had a flat tire. I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't been able to get assistance."
6583,prompt,Where is the worst place you have been stuck for a long time?
6584,General Response,"The worst place where I have been stuck is on an airplane, the doors closed but sitting at the gate with a long and unexplained delay."
6585,prompt,Do you think having your employees be afraid of how much they love you is a successful management approach?
6586,General Response,"No, I think that it is the worst approach, because they do not actually love you all if they are scared of you. In fact they probably loathe you."
6587,prompt,Do you think having your employees be afraid of how much they love you is a successful management approach?
6588,General Response,I believe that is a successful management approach because anything is better than a fear-based leadership.
6589,prompt,Do you think having your employees be afraid of how much they love you is a successful management approach?
6590,General Response,Having my employees fear me is not not a good approach because it will hinder their work performance.
6591,prompt,Do you think having your employees be afraid of how much they love you is a successful management approach?
6592,General Response,This approach doesn't make any sense to me because employees will follow managers who they respect more than anything else
6593,prompt,Do you think having your employees be afraid of how much they love you is a successful management approach?
6594,General Response,"I don't think employees should have love for you. They can like and respect you, but they should not love you. That would not be a successful management approach. That would be kind of strange."
6595,prompt,"Which sci-fi invention does not exist yet, but you look forward to most?"
6596,General Response,"I look forward to having lifelike holograms to talk to and interact with for news and stories, possibly projected from a watch."
6597,prompt,"Which sci-fi invention does not exist yet, but you look forward to most?"
6598,General Response,I really look forward to flying cars. Flying cars will allow people to get to newer locations much faster than current vehicles and law limits allow.
6599,prompt,"Which sci-fi invention does not exist yet, but you look forward to most?"
6600,General Response,"Oh, my gosh!  Wouldn't it be great if we could teleport like on Star Trek?!  I've been intrigued by this idea since I was a kid.  I look forward to the day when we can be beamed from one location to another.  It would be such a time saver.  And, of course, totally ""green""."
6601,prompt,"Which sci-fi invention does not exist yet, but you look forward to most?"
6602,General Response,I'd say time travel. There are just so many events that happened throughout history that should have never happened and I'd like to try to fix some of them.
6603,prompt,"Which sci-fi invention does not exist yet, but you look forward to most?"
6604,General Response,I would love to be able to travel time or just look into the future. It would help me be more optimistic I think.
6605,prompt,How often do you stay up past 3 a.m.?
6606,General Response,"I stay up past 3AM pretty often, especially when I don't have work or class early the next day. I enjoy being up late at night and the peace the night brings."
6607,prompt,How often do you stay up past 3 a.m.?
6608,General Response,"Not as often as I used to, because of my changing schedule. But late night is my favorite part of the day. Or night."

6610,General Response,"Every single night. I work at night, so I usually sleep during the day and stay up all night."
6611,prompt,How often do you stay up past 3 a.m.?
6612,General Response,"I stay up past 3 a.m. all the time. I've always been a night owl. Even when I was a little kid, during the summers I would stay up all night. But, then again, I've never really needed much sleep. So, it isn't like I would sleep all day."
6613,prompt,How often do you stay up past 3 a.m.?
6614,General Response,"I do not stay up past 3 am very often at all, I'm normally asleep by 1:30 am the latest every night."
6615,prompt,What are your hobbies?
6616,General Response,"I like photography, coloring, crafts and painting. I like to walk on the beach and collect seaglass and spend time withmy puppy and fiance."

6618,General Response,"I love to read, anything and everything I can get my hands (or eyes) on! I also like to work on MTurk and go to concerts."
6619,prompt,What are your hobbies?
6620,General Response,I like to read when I have time to relax and singing and dancing always makes you feel good too
6621,prompt,What are your hobbies?
6622,General Response,My hobbies are playing computer games and watching videos and shows because it is more rewarding than doing anything else.
6623,prompt,What are your hobbies?
6624,General Response,I like to go rollerblading at the park often. It's great exercise and really fun.

6628,General Response,"I have several apps. I have a ""Flo"" app to help us with conception. I have a podcast app that helps me organize my podcasts. I have a music app where I can view youtube videos. I got this app originally for music videos, but I actually watch discussions on youtube quite a bit from them and found some audiobooks too. I have one game app, which is my Sudoku game app. I have Instagram and Yelp. I think I have fewer than most, but I acquired quite a few in the past month alone, when I started traveling for the summer."
6629,prompt,How many apps do you have on your phone?
6630,General Response,"I have about 6 apps. The list is facebook, hulu, amazon music, pandora, candy crush and yahtzee. I like to play games and watch show online."

6632,General Response,I have a fair amount of apps. It's mostly just social media with some games as well.
6633,prompt,How many apps do you have on your phone?
6634,General Response,"I have about ten apps on my phone.  Most of them are games, including all of the different versions of Candy Crush."
6635,prompt,Would you rather go back in time and prevent the Titanic from sinking or prevent the 1929 stock market crash?
6636,General Response,I would rather prevent the 1929 stock market crash because I think it had a devastating impact on more people's lives.
6637,prompt,Would you rather go back in time and prevent the Titanic from sinking or prevent the 1929 stock market crash?
6638,General Response,well id go back and prevent the stock market crash because the suffering was longer compared to the titanic
6639,prompt,Would you rather go back in time and prevent the Titanic from sinking or prevent the 1929 stock market crash?
6640,General Response,"If I could go back in time I'd rather prevent the Titanic from sinking. There were families, small children and people on that boat having a good time. I'd rather they all lived."
6641,prompt,Would you rather go back in time and prevent the Titanic from sinking or prevent the 1929 stock market crash?
6642,General Response,I would rather prevent the 1929 stock market crash because the crash affected everybody in the country and many around the world.
6643,prompt,Would you rather go back in time and prevent the Titanic from sinking or prevent the 1929 stock market crash?
6644,General Response,The 1929 market crash I guess? I don't really know a lot about either but I do know the stock market crash significantly hurt a lot of people. The Titanic did too but not in the same way. The market crash had a lot more significantly lasting negative affects on people and changed the economy which also effects people who may not have been directly connected to it.
6645,prompt,Would you rather be on an airplane between two arguing passengers or next to a screaming infant?
6646,General Response,I think I would rather be next to the infant being a mom myself that does not bother me and I could possibly help the mom or dad having the issue with calming the child. Being between to fighting people is annoying and could lead to me being dragged into it weither to give an opinion or getting hit.
6647,prompt,Would you rather be on an airplane between two arguing passengers or next to a screaming infant?
6648,General Response,"The arguing passengers, obviously. Eventually they calm down. Babies do not like traveling for a long period of time and they let it be known throughout the flight."
6649,prompt,Would you rather be on an airplane between two arguing passengers or next to a screaming infant?
6650,General Response,I would rather be next to a screaming infant. There is no reason to argue on a plane for hours. At least the baby is crying because that is a reasonable thing for an infant to do.
6651,prompt,Would you rather be on an airplane between two arguing passengers or next to a screaming infant?
6652,General Response,"The screaming infant.  He'll probably shut up eventually, but idiots will argue forever.  And the kid doesn't know any better."
6653,prompt,Would you rather be on an airplane between two arguing passengers or next to a screaming infant?
6654,General Response,"I'd definitely rather be between two arguing passengers on a plane. I can't stand crying babies on a plane. At least if two people are fighting, you get a front row seat to the drama. And maybe a funny story to tell people about later."
6655,prompt,Would you rather always have a booger in your nose that moves when you breathe in and out or a piece of food stuck between your two front teeth?
6656,General Response,"If I had to choose between a booger that moves in and out when I breathe or s piece of food in between my two front teeth, I definitely choose the food between my teeth.  I would much rather not notice some minuscule piece of food then have to feel the booger flap on and out as I breathe!"
6657,prompt,Would you rather always have a booger in your nose that moves when you breathe in and out or a piece of food stuck between your two front teeth?
6658,General Response,"I'll take the booger, I'd get used to it after a while. Food stuck in between your teeth can cause cavities!"
6659,prompt,Would you rather always have a booger in your nose that moves when you breathe in and out or a piece of food stuck between your two front teeth?
6660,General Response,"I would rather have a booger in my nose, because boogers are helpful. But food would rot the teeth it was stuck to."
6661,prompt,Would you rather always have a booger in your nose that moves when you breathe in and out or a piece of food stuck between your two front teeth?
6662,General Response,I would rather have a piece of food stuck between my teeth.  Having food stuck in your teeth is less awkward then having a booger play hide and seek every time you breathe through your nose.
6663,prompt,Would you rather always have a booger in your nose that moves when you breathe in and out or a piece of food stuck between your two front teeth?
6664,General Response,"I would choose to have a piece of food stuck between my two front teeth. That way, I could simply never talk or smile and no one would know my embarrassing secret. If I had a booger in my nose that always moved when I breathed, everyone would know my disgusting secret."
6665,prompt,Have your parents influenced what goals you have?
6666,General Response,"Of course, my parents wouldn't let me do anything unless my grades were up and they were always reading books, so that's why I am academic and I'm such a bookworm."
6667,prompt,Have your parents influenced what goals you have?
6668,General Response,"My parents influenced past goals, like going to college. Now my mom just wants grand kids, and she is definitely pushing for that."
6669,prompt,Have your parents influenced what goals you have?
6670,General Response,"yes my goals were nursing as I have a helpful nature, but my mother was also a nurse which was inspiring"
6671,prompt,Have your parents influenced what goals you have?
6672,General Response,My dad wanted me to be a doctor but didn't influence me because I had a fear of blood and organs.
6673,prompt,Have your parents influenced what goals you have?
6674,General Response,Yes they have as a matter of fact they encouraged me to stay in college when I so desparately wanted to quit.  They explained the importance of continuing with my education in hopes of getting into the field of study that I was interested in.  They also said it would make it easier to find a good job once I complete four years of college.
6675,prompt,Favorite place to get fast food? Why?
6676,General Response,"My favorite fast food restaurant is canes! I love their three finger combo meal. It comes with 3 chicken strips,wavy fries, Garlic bread, lemonade or iced tea, and finally a delicious taste of cane's sauce."
6677,prompt,Favorite place to get fast food? Why?
6678,General Response,"Chick-Fil-A  is my favorite fast food joint because I love their special sauces. I guess chicken is chicken but man, it's so good."
6679,prompt,Favorite place to get fast food? Why?
6680,General Response,"Bojangles. They have the BEST chicken and sweet tea. My favorite thing to get from there is a chicken biscuit (literally just a piece of fried chicken on a buttery biscuit), their french fries with extra seasoning, dirty rice and a sweet tea. Nothing better than a Bojangles biscuit."
6681,prompt,Favorite place to get fast food? Why?
6682,General Response,My favorite fast food restaurant is Arby's because they have good roast beef sandwiches and their sauce is wonderful.
6683,prompt,Favorite place to get fast food? Why?
6684,General Response,"I prefer Sonic, which is a fast food drive-in. Their burgers are great and they have creative soda drinks."
6685,prompt,"What would you do if you could do anything for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, assuming money were no object?"
6686,General Response,"I would sit in the lobby of the British Colonial Hotel in Nassau, Bahamas sipping on a cool tropical drink.  I've done that many times on my visits to the Bahamas.  Being in the Bahamas takes me to a warm, fuzzy place."
6687,prompt,"What would you do if you could do anything for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, assuming money were no object?"
6688,General Response,I would sit and be with friends for eight hours a day. I really enjoy being with friends everyday and being with them everyday will be amazing. If I was with friends then we could travel and do new activities together.
6689,prompt,"What would you do if you could do anything for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, assuming money were no object?"
6690,General Response,"I would play with my children, or home school my kids. I mean if money is no object I would try best to build a strong relationship with my kids."
6691,prompt,"What would you do if you could do anything for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, assuming money were no object?"
6692,General Response,I would play at a casino on the slot machines.  It's thoughtless and so enjoyable!
6693,prompt,"What would you do if you could do anything for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, assuming money were no object?"
6694,General Response,I would travel the world and see as much of it as possible and I would take a cruise around the world and sit there and watch the ocean all day.
6695,prompt,What do you think of online education?
6696,General Response,"As a 61-year-old, I find the concept of online education fascinating.  except for a very short free on-line course I took a few years ago, I have no experience in it.  When I went to college in the mid to late 1970s, I could never imagine a person getting educated on-line.  I would have thought that would be something that wouldn't happen for, maybe, another century.  I think it's wonderful that people can organize their life around their education; take courses from the comfort of their own home.  However, and perhaps it's because of my age, I think there's something lacking in it...I think it's more interesting when people are in the same room exchanging ideas.  I know about chat rooms but it's not the same as being physically in the same place as others.  So I think online education is good, but certainly not ideal."
6697,prompt,What do you think of online education?
6698,General Response,"I have taken multiple online classes, and I would not recommend them to people that are lazy."
6699,prompt,What do you think of online education?
6700,General Response,I think it's a good alternative. With the ability to have classes away from a class it makes it more comfortable.
6701,prompt,What do you think of online education?
6702,General Response,"I think online education is great for older people with busy lives. However, I think children benefit more from traditional schooling where they can learn social skills."
6703,prompt,What do you think of online education?
6704,General Response,"Classroom is much better. Yet, I think online education can be resourceful for individuals who would like to continue education at home."
6705,prompt,Would you rather suffer from spontaneous shouting or unpredictable fainting spells?
6706,General Response,I would rather shout spontaneously because I would be too prone to accidents if I fainted at random.
6707,prompt,Would you rather suffer from spontaneous shouting or unpredictable fainting spells?
6708,General Response,"I would rather suffer from spontaneous shouting. Though embarrassing and sometimes rather inappropriate, unpredictable fainting spells could be very dangerous to myself and others."
6709,prompt,Would you rather suffer from spontaneous shouting or unpredictable fainting spells?
6710,General Response,"I would rather suffer from unpredictable fainting spells. While it would be embarrassing and frightening, in comparison to spontaneous shouting, I feel like it would be better explainable in public."
6711,prompt,Would you rather suffer from spontaneous shouting or unpredictable fainting spells?
6712,General Response,"If I had to choose between spontaneous shouting or unpredictably fainting, I think I'd choose shouting. I never have the guts to yell at anyone normally, so it would be exciting to just be able to scream in someone's face without control ... Unless I'm in a job interview. Then that wouldn't be so fun."
6713,prompt,Would you rather suffer from spontaneous shouting or unpredictable fainting spells?
6714,General Response,"I would rather suffer from spontaneous shouting. Something severe could happen to me with the unpredictable fainting spells--I could pass out while driving (that's not good), for example. In an even worst scenario, someone could take advantage of me."
6715,prompt,Which season are you most active in?
6716,General Response,"I'm most active in summer. My kids are out of school and we go to he beach, pool, bike rides. We don't have time constrictions and stay up late doing fun things."
6717,prompt,Which season are you most active in?
6718,General Response,I'm most active in the winter because I love the cold. Keeps me from over heating.
6719,prompt,Which season are you most active in?
6720,General Response,"Well obviously I am most active in the summer time. I have a boat that I like to drive really fast, if you know what I mean."
6721,prompt,Which season are you most active in?
6722,General Response,"I'm most active in the summer. The Carolina heat and humidity don't bother me a bit, but cold weather in the winter turns me into a hermit."
6723,prompt,Which season are you most active in?
6724,General Response,"Summer season is my most active season. It used to not be that way, but I love running outside and summer's in Washington offer the most rain-free days to get my run on. If I didn't have the younger kids, I'd probably say spring or fall, because of the cooler days, however right now it is summer time."
6725,prompt,What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten from a fortune cookie?
6726,General Response,"The one that said ""A kiss can beautify souls, hearts and thoughts"" because I showed it to my wife and we have been kissing more often ever since."
6727,prompt,What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten from a fortune cookie?
6728,General Response,It told me my lucky numbers. I played them and won like fifty dollars!
6729,prompt,What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten from a fortune cookie?

6731,prompt,What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten from a fortune cookie?
6732,General Response,"I opened a fortune cookie that said, ""Take a risk next week - it will pay off"" and I had forgotten about it until a friend mentioned a new job opportunity.  The pay, commune and benefits were much better than my current job but I wasn't sure I was qualified.  I ended up going through the interview process and getting the job!"
6733,prompt,What is the best piece of advice you have ever gotten from a fortune cookie?
6734,General Response,The best advice i have received from a fortune cookie was that fear is the only obstacle standing between me and success
6735,prompt,Do you prefer to go off the beaten path when you travel?
6736,General Response,I usually stick to well-mapped areas when I travel. I get lost easily even with GPS and printed directions.
6737,prompt,Do you prefer to go off the beaten path when you travel?
6738,General Response,"There is nothing more fun than experiencing things in an unknown place that the average public will not.  I like to travel off the beaten path, but not to the extent our lives will be in danger doing so."
6739,prompt,Do you prefer to go off the beaten path when you travel?
6740,General Response,"I would only do that if I was familiar with the place I was traveling to. Ever watch the ID channel? I'm not too much of a risk taker and so if it's a new place, being safer with staying on the beaten path is my choice."
6741,prompt,Do you prefer to go off the beaten path when you travel?
6742,General Response,I prefer to go off the beaten path because it often makes for a better story.
6743,prompt,Do you prefer to go off the beaten path when you travel?
6744,General Response,I am far to scared about getting lost or kidnapped to go off the beaten path!
6745,prompt,What is the biggest change you want to make in your life?
6746,General Response,I think the biggest change in my life I would like to make would be my financial situation and I do a lot of different things but it seems like I spend a lot of time and energy!
6747,prompt,What is the biggest change you want to make in your life?
6748,General Response,"I want to lose weight and be healthier, as I get older my health is affecting my day to day life."

6750,General Response,I want to become debt free and move to the east coast.
6751,prompt,What is the biggest change you want to make in your life?
6752,General Response,The biggest change i want to make in my life is waking up early because for most of my adult life i have been waking up very late.
6753,prompt,What is the biggest change you want to make in your life?
6754,General Response,"I want to move to another country for a few years, to experience another culture and get perspective."
6755,prompt,Do you prefer to watch or read the news?
6756,General Response,"I prefer to read the news, on my computer to be specific because I can do it whenever I want and it is always the most up to date."
6757,prompt,Do you prefer to watch or read the news?
6758,General Response,I prefer to read the news because it is much harder to skew the facts when writing.
6759,prompt,Do you prefer to watch or read the news?
6760,General Response,I prefer to watch the news. You never know when there might be a real-time blooper that a reporter makes.
6761,prompt,Do you prefer to watch or read the news?
6762,General Response,"I prefer to read the news, if i read I don't miss the little details, or I can go back and read over the important information and understand it better"
6763,prompt,Do you prefer to watch or read the news?
6764,General Response,I prefer to read the news because news correspondents are generally more annoying than the journalists who write the stories.

6766,General Response,I would rather be a doctor because I'd like to minimize my time spent with sick people.
6767,prompt,Would you rather be a doctor or a nurse?
6768,General Response,I would rather be nurse. Doctors are very respected but have so much responsibility and schooling to go through I do not think I would be able to handle it. I like to be able to help a wide array of patients and to work as more of a team rather than being the one to have to make all the important decisions.
6769,prompt,Would you rather be a doctor or a nurse?
6770,General Response,"Neither, but if I had to choose, I would want to be a nurse because they don't have to spend as much time in school."
6771,prompt,Would you rather be a doctor or a nurse?
6772,General Response,I would rather be a doctor because they make more money and receive more recognition.
6773,prompt,Would you rather be a doctor or a nurse?
6774,General Response,I'd rather be a doctor because they make more money and seem to do less work.
6775,prompt,What is the deal with fidget spinners?
6776,General Response,I have no idea. I think people spend more time fidgeting with them than they use it to prevent fidgeting.
6777,prompt,What is the deal with fidget spinners?
6778,General Response,I dunno but my kid has one and I just don't get it. Him and his friends were all spinning them like it was the latest and greatest thing ever.
6779,prompt,What is the deal with fidget spinners?
6780,General Response,"Fidget spinners have really burst out this year, and it's basically a way to keep ADHD kids or kids with short attention spans focused in class or while doing work. Teachers, however, hate the latest invention and are starting to ban it from classrooms. There's a debate on whether the product actually works or is helpful or not. Some people are outraged that teachers are banning something like this from their classrooms while others feel that the spinners actually distract the students even more, as well as keeping the ""normal"" kids from focusing as well."
6781,prompt,What is the deal with fidget spinners?
6782,General Response,"I don't know, I don't get it either. I guess because its relatively cheap and easy to manipulate."
6783,prompt,What is the deal with fidget spinners?
6784,General Response,"They were originally made to keep people with autism busy and calm. I think their purpose was then extended to help people with ADD, ADHD, anxiety, and depression. People who didn't need them decided they were cool and then turned them into a fad. It's pretty annoying."
6785,prompt,What smell brings back great memories?
6786,General Response,The smell over flowers and after rain brings back great memories because it reminds me of my husband when we were dating.
6787,prompt,What smell brings back great memories?
6788,General Response,I love the fake fruit smells of scratch and sniff stickers because those smells remind me of being praised for doing well on a lesson.

6793,prompt,What smell brings back great memories?
6794,General Response,"Campfires! Whenever I stumble across a bonfire, I am instantly transported back to my childhood. My family and I used to spend portions of our summer on Lake Huron with my mom's best friends. We would play on the beach all day, and then at night, all of us kids would gather around a bonfire and make s'mores while we gaze up at the endless amount of stars above us. The aroma of burnt wood and toasted marshmallow always brings me back to my great childhood memories of endless fun and worry-free days."
6795,prompt,Would you rather marry someone very rich or someone who is very handsome/beautiful?
6796,General Response,I would rather marry someone very rich because I am not vain. Appearance does not matter to me.
6797,prompt,Would you rather marry someone very rich or someone who is very handsome/beautiful?
6798,General Response,"I would rather marry someone very rich, because looks mean little to nothing. But honestly, there should be a third option: ""or someone very FUNNY"", because that's the best option!"
6799,prompt,Would you rather marry someone very rich or someone who is very handsome/beautiful?
6800,General Response,I would rather marry someone who is very beautiful because money can't buy good looks.
6801,prompt,Would you rather marry someone very rich or someone who is very handsome/beautiful?
6802,General Response,"If their interior beauty is set aside. Is it better to love someone for their riches or for their looks? At least loving them for their beauty is still loving something about them, whereas loving them for their riches is loving something aside from them and wouldn't really be loving them at all."
6803,prompt,Would you rather marry someone very rich or someone who is very handsome/beautiful?
6804,General Response,"I think I'd rather marry someone very rich, to be honest! I know it would be better to be with a wealthy, unattractive person than to be married to a gorgeous person with financial problems."

6806,General Response,Bad Boys with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. I can't take anything Martin Lawrence does seriously.
6807,prompt,What is the best cheesy action movie?
6808,General Response,"I have quite a few ""guilty pleasure"" movies - those that are so bad that you cringe and feel palpable embarrassment for the actors, but my absolute favorite has to be Waterworld. It's so bad I'd almost cheer at certain scenes. Seriously, though: why was everyone so dirty when they were completely and totally surrounded by water???"
6809,prompt,What is the best cheesy action movie?
6810,General Response,"Anything with Sylvester Stallone is a cheesy action movie, don't you think?"
6811,prompt,What is the best cheesy action movie?
6812,General Response,The best cheesy action movie is Machete Kills. Anything with Danny Trejo is a masterpiece.
6813,prompt,What is the best cheesy action movie?
6814,General Response,"The best cheesy action movie, at least out of the ones that I have seen which isn't many, would be Rush Hour. They movies are pretty funny, but the action scenes are over the top. The main characters' dynamic saves the movies for me though."
6815,prompt,Have you traveled to any different countries? Which ones?
6816,General Response,"Yeah I have! When I was in high school, my family and I traveled to Australia for a month during Christmas. The trip was absolutely beautiful and it was really nice to escape the brutal Michigan winter! I also visit Canada a lot since I am from the Detroit area. Even though Canada is less than an hour away, it is always really exciting to cross the border and experience the differences in the countries."
6817,prompt,Have you traveled to any different countries? Which ones?
6818,General Response,"I haven't yet, but I will one day soon. My brother lives in Japan and I hope to visit him one day. I'd also like to see Africa."

6823,prompt,Have you traveled to any different countries? Which ones?
6824,General Response,"I haven't traveled to any different countries, but I wish I have! Someday I'll make it to Italy and have some real pasta."
6825,prompt,How can technology improve education? Can it hurt education?
6826,General Response,Technology gives us access to much more information which is good for education. I think it could hurt education by making us more lazy.
6827,prompt,How can technology improve education? Can it hurt education?
6828,General Response,I think it can only improve it. Incorporating it into education will only give students an edge when they have to use it regularly.
6829,prompt,How can technology improve education? Can it hurt education?
6830,General Response,"Technology is the future and it is a tool that makes life more efficient. It is necessary to incorporate it into education. Its misuse would be when teachers provide teaching moments using technology their presence not necessary. For example, when they require students to watch online videos and pursue online assignments. I am not sure why a teacher is necessary or attending class is necessary if the teacher is not actively participating in stimulating the students. Technology should be an enhancement. Public education for the most part is about socialization and stimulation of young minds."
6831,prompt,How can technology improve education? Can it hurt education?
6832,General Response,Technology can improve education by making reducing teachers's workload but it can also hurt it if teachers and students get distracted by other aspects of it.
6833,prompt,How can technology improve education? Can it hurt education?
6834,General Response,"It seems like everything involves technology so it needs to be utilized in education so students know how to use it. Unfortunately, students are getting less human interaction when they use too much technology."
6835,prompt,Would you rather have friends that are smarter than you or friends that are be much better looking than you?
6836,General Response,"I would rather have friends that are smarter than me.  Looks are fleeting, but learning is lifelong.  There are so many things that I can learn by having smarter friends.  It would actually make me smarter too!"
6837,prompt,Would you rather have friends that are smarter than you or friends that are be much better looking than you?
6838,General Response,I would rather have friends that are smarter than me so I could learn things from them.
6839,prompt,Would you rather have friends that are smarter than you or friends that are be much better looking than you?
6840,General Response,"I'd rather have friends that are smarter than me, because then they can help me out wth things like schoolwork and such. I feel like if ALL my friends were better looking than me, I'd always feel that I wasn't good enough and I'd be pretty insecure all the time."
6841,prompt,Would you rather have friends that are smarter than you or friends that are be much better looking than you?
6842,General Response,"I would rather have friends that are smarter than me.  That way, you are learning new things all the time, looks are not important at all in a friend."
6843,prompt,Would you rather have friends that are smarter than you or friends that are be much better looking than you?
6844,General Response,I would rather have friends much better looking than me because I could still have level-headed conversations.

6997,prompt,Let's talk about politics.
6998,General Response,"I am a liberal Democrat. I am having a difficult time with our current political climate in the United States. I feel that the whole country is in chaos because the current administration is taking part in unprofessional and short sighted things. The immigration reform, and insurance reform that is currently going on I strongly disagree with. I am concerned about the fact that there are many facts stating that our last presidential election was tampered with and our government is doing nothing about it because they were put into office by the tampering. I feel that our current president has far too much admiration for dictators throughout the world and throughout history. To me it seems as if the writing is on the wall for mass exodus and riots being incited because our current administration does not stand by the meaning of a true democracy."
6999,prompt,Let's talk about politics.
7000,General Response,I don't talk about politics much because I'm not very active in it.
7001,prompt,Let's talk about politics.
7002,General Response,Politics have been a hot topic around my home and work since the presidential election. Everyone has an idea or opinion here lately. We need to put aside all the politics and get to business about our country and our economy.
7003,prompt,Let's talk about politics.
7004,General Response,"Oh boy, politics? I don't follow politics generally, but this last election was sure a crazy one! Now that Trump is in office, it almost feels like everything in the world has become unstable. I do see some positive changes that have been made, but I also see a lot of friction and I'm afraid of North Korea at this point. Plus all of the shootings and suicide bombs recently have got me quite concerned. I guess time will tell, but because of politics, I think things may get a little crazy."

7007,prompt,"Are you gluten-free? If so, why? If not, tell me what you think of the gluten-free fad. "

7009,prompt,"Are you gluten-free? If so, why? If not, tell me what you think of the gluten-free fad. "

7013,prompt,"Are you gluten-free? If so, why? If not, tell me what you think of the gluten-free fad. "
7014,General Response,"I'm not personally gluten free. If a person has a diagnosed insensitivity to gluten which hinders their daily life then I believe they should manage the gluten they consume. Otherwise I don't see any health benefit with cutting out gluten, just ensure things are eaten in moderation."

Cotton from cottonwood trees make my eyes itchy and watery. I am on medication for my seasonal allergies from March to September every year."
7023,prompt,"Do you have any allergies? If so, what are they? If not, tell me about someone else you know who has one. "

7047,prompt,Star Trek or Star Wars? Explain your answer.

7049,prompt,Star Trek or Star Wars? Explain your answer.
7050,General Response,"Star Wars is definitely better than Star Trek. Star Wars has action, love, heroism, explosions, conflict and many more things. It is also really neat that they are now coming out with other spin offs to tell you the stories of other heroes from the same world."

7052,General Response,For me I prefer star trek. I find it more entertaining and have been watching it for years.

7495,prompt,Describe some conflict in the world. How can we improve that situation?
7496,General Response,"Trump is a big conflict there is many things that should be done to get him out of the office and no longer President.

He needs to learn that everyone is just the same and should be accepted for who they are.

7594,General Response,"What the schools have right is that teachers are working hard to meet the needs of all students and provide them a safe environment to learn.What is wrong is that teachers and administrators have their hands tied when it comes to discipline.  Schools should have a 3 strikes your out rule for a year, a child is in trouble in class 3 times and moves to admin, 3 times in trouble with admin they move to ISS, 3 days of ISS they are out for the year.  They can retake the grade the next year or test out and move on if able.  Removing students who are disruptive will allow those who want to learn the ability to make huge progress."

Assorted Flowerpots
Little clay pots make great cloches for protecting young plants from overnight frosts.
Here, the latest tips and tricks from Paul James, host of Gardening by the Yard:

1. To remove the salt deposits that form on clay pots, combine equal parts white vinegar, rubbing alcohol and water in a spray bottle. Apply the mixture to the pot and scrub with a plastic brush. Let the pot dry before you plant anything in it.

2. To prevent accumulating dirt under your fingernails while you work in the garden, draw your fingernails across a bar of soap and you'll effectively seal the undersides of your nails so dirt can't collect beneath them. Then, after you've finished in the garden, use a nailbrush to remove the soap and your nails will be sparkling clean.

3. To prevent the line on your string trimmer from jamming or breaking, treat with a spray vegetable oil before installing it in the trimmer.

4. Turn a long-handled tool into a measuring stick! Lay a long-handled garden tool on the ground, and next to it place a tape measure. Using a permanent marker, write inch and foot marks on the handle. When you need to space plants a certain distance apart (from just an inch to several feet) you'll already have a measuring device in your hand."

7926,General Response,"I believe in ghosts, or at least in spiritual beings. I have been held down by unknown entities while lying in bed.
